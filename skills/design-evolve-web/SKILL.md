# Design Evolve — Merge New Reference into Design Language

Analyze a new reference site mid-project and selectively merge its design elements into the existing design language. Shows a diff of what would change, lets the user choose what to adopt.

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

Both `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json` must exist. If either is missing:
> "No existing design language found. Run `/design-analyze` and `/design-language` first to establish a baseline before evolving."

## Step 2: Validate URL

Validate that the `<url>` argument starts with `http://` or `https://` and contains only URL-safe characters: letters, digits, `:`, `/`, `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, `?`, `=`, `%`, `+`, `@`, `,`.

Reject any URL containing characters outside this allowlist.

If validation fails:
> "Invalid URL: `<url>`. URLs must start with `http://` or `https://` and may only contain URL-safe characters (`a-zA-Z0-9` and `:/.\\-_~?=%+@,`). Offending characters: `<list of disallowed characters found>`."

## Step 3: Run Dembrandt on New URL

Pin the extractor output to a known path so the diff reads an exact file — never a guessed filename. `<host>` is the URL's hostname (e.g. `https://linear.app/features` → `linear.app`). One Bash invocation (shell state does not persist between calls):

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/design/raw"
npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --out "$AW_DIR/design/raw/<host>.json"
```

Verify the pinned file exists and is non-empty; if not, report the dembrandt error and stop. Then Read `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/raw/<host>.json` — this exact file is the merge input.

## Step 4: Merge (shared algorithm)

Read `$SHARED_DIR/token-merge.md` and follow it exactly:

- **Step A** — category diff table (NEW / DIFFERENT / UNCHANGED) against current `design-tokens.json`
- **Step B** — **Ask the user** Adopt / Adapt / Ignore per group; **Adapt requires the follow-up **Ask the user** capturing the literal replacement value**
- **Step C** — write merged `design-tokens.json`; **unconditionally** append the consultation to `.impeccable.md ## Sources`; set `baseline_stale` in `screens.json` when anything was adopted or adapted
- **Step D** — report counts and exact before→after values

The pinned `design/raw/<host>.json` is kept — do not delete it.

## Next steps

- `/design-mockup-web` — rebuild mockups with the updated tokens (existing baselines are now marked stale)
- `/design-refine` — apply the evolved language to existing screens
