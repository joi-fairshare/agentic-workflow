## Codebase Navigation

Prefer **Serena** for all code exploration — LSP-based symbol lookup is faster and more precise than file scanning.

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Find a function, class, or symbol | `serena: find_symbol` |
| What references symbol X? | `serena: find_referencing_symbols` |
| Module/file structure overview | `serena: get_symbols_overview` |
| Search for a string or pattern | `Grep` (fallback) |
| Read a full file | `Read` (fallback) |

## Preamble — Bootstrap Check

Before running this skill, verify the environment is set up:

```bash
# Derive repo slug
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$REMOTE_URL" ]; then
  REPO_SLUG=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
else
  REPO_SLUG=$(basename "$(pwd)")
fi
echo "repo-slug: $REPO_SLUG"

# Check bootstrap status
SKILLS_OK=true
for s in review postReview addressReview enhancePrompt bootstrap rootCause bugHunt bugReport shipRelease syncDocs weeklyRetro officeHours productReview archReview design-analyze design-analyze-web design-analyze-ios design-language design-evolve design-evolve-web design-evolve-ios design-mockup design-mockup-web design-mockup-ios design-implement design-implement-web design-implement-ios design-refine design-verify design-verify-web design-verify-ios verify-app verify-web verify-ios; do
  [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s" ] || SKILLS_OK=false
done

BRIDGE_OK=false
lsof -i TCP:3100 -sTCP:LISTEN &>/dev/null && BRIDGE_OK=true

RULES_OK=false
[ -d ".claude/rules" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null)" ] && RULES_OK=true

echo "skills-symlinked: $SKILLS_OK"
echo "bridge-running: $BRIDGE_OK"
echo "rules-directory: $RULES_OK"
```

Domain rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically per glob — no action needed if `rules-directory: true`.

If `SKILLS_OK=false` or `BRIDGE_OK=false`, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
> "Agentic Workflow is not fully set up. Run setup.sh now? (yes/no)"

If **yes**: run `bash <path-to-agentic-workflow>/setup.sh` (resolve path from the review skill symlink target).
If **no**: warn that some features may not work, then continue.

If `RULES_OK=false` (and `SKILLS_OK` and `BRIDGE_OK` are both true), do not offer setup.sh. Instead, show:
> "Domain rules not found — run `/bootstrap` to generate `.claude/rules/` for this repo."

Create the output directory for this repo:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG"
```

## Session Context

Load prior work state for this repo from prism-mcp before starting.

**1. Derive a topic string** — synthesize 3–5 words from the skill argument and task intent:
- `/officeHours add dark mode` → `"dark mode UI feature"`
- `/rootCause TypeError cannot read properties` → `"TypeError cannot read properties"`
- `/review 42` → use the PR title once fetched: `"PR {title} review"`
- No argument → use the most specific descriptor available: `"{REPO_SLUG} {skill-name}"`

**2. Load context from prism-mcp:**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context — project: REPO_SLUG, level: "standard",
  toolAction: "Loading session context", toolSummary: "<skill-name> context recovery"
```

Store the returned `expected_version` — you will need it at Session Close.

**3. Surface results:**
- If the response contains a non-empty summary or prior decisions:
  > **Prior context:** {summary}
  Use this to inform your approach before continuing.
- If prism-mcp returns an error, surface it and stop:
  > "prism-mcp unavailable: {error}. Ensure prism-mcp is running and registered."

## Session Close

> **Run at the end of every skill**, after all work is complete and the report has been shown to the user.

Save a structured ledger entry and update the live handoff state for this repo.

**1. Save ledger entry (immutable audit trail):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger — project: REPO_SLUG,
  conversation_id: "<skill-name>-<ISO-timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-08T14:32:00Z>",
  summary: "<one paragraph describing what was accomplished this session>",
  todos: ["<any open items left incomplete>", ...],
  files_changed: ["<paths of files created or modified>", ...],
  decisions: ["<key decisions made during this skill run>", ...]
```

**2. Update handoff state (mutable live state for next session):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff — project: REPO_SLUG,
  expected_version: <value returned by session_load_context>,
  open_todos: ["<open items not yet completed>", ...],
  active_branch: "<current git branch from: git branch --show-current>",
  last_summary: "<one sentence: what this skill just did>",
  key_context: "<critical facts the next session must know — constraints, decisions, blockers>"
```

If either call fails, surface the error:
> "prism-mcp session save failed: {error}. Context may not persist to next session."

## Design Context — Load Design Language

### Block 1: Load design language

1. Read `.impeccable.md` if it exists:
   - Note the brand personality and aesthetic direction
   - Note the `## Sources` section: the URLs used to build the design tokens
2. Read `design-tokens.json` if it exists (W3C DTCG: colors, typography, spacing)
3. Read `planning/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` if it exists (component catalog, design principles)

If none exist and this skill requires design context:
> "No design language found. Run `/design-language [url1 url2...]` to synthesize from
> reference materials, then retry."

### Block 2: Dynamic component inventory

Run the following scan and surface results as context before proceeding with the skill's own steps.

**Part A: Component library detection**

Read `package.json` (if it exists) and check `dependencies` + `devDependencies` for known libraries:

| Package pattern | Library |
|-----------------|---------|
| `@radix-ui/*` | Radix UI |
| `shadcn-ui`, `@shadcn/*` | shadcn/ui |
| `@headlessui/*` | Headless UI |
| `react-aria`, `@react-aria/*` | React Aria |
| `@mui/*` | Material UI |
| `@chakra-ui/*` | Chakra UI |
| `@mantine/*` | Mantine |
| `antd` | Ant Design |
| `@nextui-org/*` | NextUI |
| `daisyui` | daisyUI |

Cross-reference with the `## Sources` URLs from `.impeccable.md` — if a source URL matches a known component library's docs site (e.g., `ui.shadcn.com`, `radix-ui.com`, `mantine.dev`), note it as the detected library even if `package.json` doesn't yet include it.

For iOS: check Swift files for `import SwiftUI` (standard) or third-party component libs.

**Part B: Repo primitive scan**

```
Glob("src/components/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}")
Glob("components/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}")
Glob("app/components/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}")
Glob("ui/src/components/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}")
Glob("**/*.swift", limit to top 2 directory levels)
```

Collect file names (not contents), deduplicate, and derive component names from filenames
(e.g., `button.tsx` → `Button`, `card-header.tsx` → `CardHeader`).

Surface as a context note before proceeding:

```
Component context:
  Library:    shadcn/ui (detected from package.json + impeccable.md sources)
  Primitives: Button, Card, Input, Dialog, Badge, Separator (+7 more)

  Use these components in mockups and implementations before inventing new ones.
```

If no library and no primitives found: note "No component library or repo primitives detected — generate from scratch using design tokens."

### Block 3: Orchestration overview

```
Design pipeline:
  /design-language [urls]  →  synthesize tokens + brand personality
  /design-mockup <screen>  →  HTML (web) or SwiftUI (iOS) mockup
  /design-implement        →  production code from approved mockup
  /design-refine           →  Impeccable polish pass
  /design-verify           →  screenshot diff vs mockup baseline

  /design-evolve  can run anytime to merge new reference materials.
```

# Design Evolve — Merge New Reference into Design Language

Analyze a new reference site mid-project and selectively merge its design elements into the existing design language. Shows a diff of what would change, lets the user choose what to adopt.

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

Both `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json` must exist. If either is missing:
> "No existing design language found. Run `/design-analyze` and `/design-language` first to establish a baseline before evolving."

## Step 2: Validate URL

Validate that the `<url>` argument starts with `http://` or `https://` and contains only URL-safe characters: letters, digits, `:`, `/`, `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, `?`, `=`, `%`, `+`, `@`, `,`.

Reject any URL containing characters outside this allowlist.

If validation fails:
> "Invalid URL: `<url>`. URLs must start with `http://` or `https://` and may only contain URL-safe characters (`a-zA-Z0-9` and `:/.\\-_~?=%+@,`). Offending characters: `<list of disallowed characters found>`."

## Step 3: Run Dembrandt on New URL

```bash
npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --save-output
```

Read the Dembrandt output.

## Step 4: Present Diff

Compare new tokens against existing `design-tokens.json`:

```
Design Evolution Diff
=====================

Source: <url>

NEW tokens (not in current language):
  color.accent-blue: #3B82F6
  spacing.2xl: 3rem
  typography.mono: "JetBrains Mono"

DIFFERENT values (exist but differ):
  color.primary: current=#1A1A2E → new=#0F172A
  spacing.lg: current=2rem → new=1.5rem

UNCHANGED (same in both):
  color.background: #FFFFFF
  typography.body.fontSize: 1rem
```

## Step 5: Ask What to Adopt

For each category (new tokens, different values), ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Which elements would you like to adopt from <url>?
> - **Adopt**: take the new value as-is
> - **Adapt**: use the new value as inspiration but modify
> - **Ignore**: keep current value unchanged"

## Step 6: Update Design Files

Apply the user's choices:
1. Update `design-tokens.json` with adopted/adapted tokens
2. Update `.impeccable.md` if the new reference changes aesthetic direction:
   - Add to references list if adopted
   - Note any style shifts in relevant sections

## Step 7: Report

```
Design Language Updated
=======================

Adopted:  N tokens from <url>
Adapted:  N tokens (modified from <url>)
Ignored:  N tokens (kept current values)

Updated files:
  design-tokens.json (N changes)
  .impeccable.md (references updated)

Next steps:
  • Run /design-implement web|swiftui to regenerate platform-specific token files
  • Run /design-verify to check implementation against updated tokens
```

## Rules

- Never overwrite existing tokens without user confirmation
- Show exact before/after values for all changes
- Preserve token structure — only update values, don't reorganize
- Clean up Dembrandt output files after processing
