#   LOCK_NAME=browser  source skill-lock.sh   # for browser/Playwright sessions

#   acquire_lock    # blocks until lock acquired or timeout
#   # ... use resource ...
#   release_lock    # release when done
#
# Environment:
#   LOCK_NAME             — lock identifier written into the lock file path (default: "skill")
#   SKILL_LOCK_TIMEOUT    — max seconds to wait (default: 120)
