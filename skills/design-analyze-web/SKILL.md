description: Run Dembrandt on reference site URLs to extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) as W3C DTCG JSON. Merges multiple sites, resolves conflicts by frequency/prominence, and writes design-tokens.json.

## Shared Setup

Read [the shared Codex skill preamble](../_preamble.md) before proceeding.
Read [the shared design preamble](../_design-preamble.md) before continuing.

# Design Analyze — Extract Design Tokens from Reference Sites

Runs Dembrandt CLI on one or more reference website URLs, extracts design tokens, merges across sites, and writes `design-tokens.json` in W3C DTCG format.

## Step 1: Validate Arguments

The user must provide at least one URL. Parse all URLs from the argument string.

If no URLs provided:
> "Usage: `design-analyze <url> [url2...]`
> Example: `design-analyze https://linear.app https://vercel.com`"

## Step 2: Validate URLs

Validate that each URL starts with `http://` or `https://` and contains only URL-safe characters: letters, digits, `:`, `/`, `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, `?`, `=`, `%`, `+`, `@`, `,`.

Reject any URL containing characters outside this allowlist.

If any argument fails validation:
> "Invalid URL: `<argument>`. URLs must start with `http://` or `https://` and may only contain URL-safe characters (`a-zA-Z0-9` and `:/.\\-_~?=%+@,`). Offending characters: `<list of disallowed characters found>`."

## Step 3: Run Dembrandt on Each URL

For each URL, run:

```bash
npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --save-output
```

If the user's design system includes dark mode, also run:

```bash
npx dembrandt <url> --dtcg --dark-mode --save-output
```

Collect all output files. Dembrandt saves JSON files with the extracted tokens.

## Step 4: Merge Extracted Tokens

If multiple URLs were provided:

1. Read all Dembrandt output files
2. Identify shared patterns across sites (common colors, similar typography scales, consistent spacing)
3. Resolve conflicts by frequency and prominence:
   - Token present in most sites wins
   - If tied, prefer the token from the first URL (primary reference)
4. Synthesize: what's shared across references, what's distinctive about each

If single URL, use its tokens directly.

## Step 5: Write design-tokens.json

Write the merged tokens to `design-tokens.json` at the project root in W3C DTCG format:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://design-tokens.org/schema.json",
  "color": {
    "primary": { "$value": "#...", "$type": "color" },
    "secondary": { "$value": "#...", "$type": "color" }
  },
  "typography": {
    "heading": {
      "fontFamily": { "$value": "...", "$type": "fontFamily" },
      "fontSize": { "$value": "...", "$type": "dimension" }
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "sm": { "$value": "...", "$type": "dimension" },
    "md": { "$value": "...", "$type": "dimension" }
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Present Summary

Display a summary of extracted tokens:

```
Design Token Extraction Complete
=================================

Source(s): <url1>, <url2>, ...

Colors:     N tokens extracted
Typography: N tokens extracted
Spacing:    N tokens extracted
Radii:      N tokens extracted
Elevation:  N tokens extracted
Motion:     N tokens extracted

Written to: design-tokens.json

Next steps:
  1. Run design-language to define brand personality
  2. Run design-mockup <screen> to generate HTML mockups
  3. Run design-implement web|swiftui to generate production code
```

## Rules

- Always use `--dtcg` flag for W3C DTCG format output
- Do not modify existing `design-tokens.json` without warning — if it exists, ask before overwriting
- Clean up Dembrandt output files after merging (keep only `design-tokens.json`)
- If Dembrandt is not installed, advise: "Run `npm install -g dembrandt` or re-run `setup.sh`"
