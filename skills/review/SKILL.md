## Codebase Navigation

Prefer **Serena** for all code exploration — LSP-based symbol lookup is faster and more precise than file scanning.

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Find a function, class, or symbol | `serena: find_symbol` |
| What references symbol X? | `serena: find_referencing_symbols` |
| Module/file structure overview | `serena: get_symbols_overview` |
| Search for a string or pattern | `Grep` (fallback) |
| Read a full file | `Read` (fallback) |

## Preamble — Bootstrap Check

Before running this skill, verify the environment is set up:

```bash
# Derive repo slug
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$REMOTE_URL" ]; then
  REPO_SLUG=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
else
  REPO_SLUG=$(basename "$(pwd)")
fi
echo "repo-slug: $REPO_SLUG"

# Check bootstrap status
SKILLS_OK=true
for s in review postReview addressReview enhancePrompt bootstrap rootCause bugHunt bugReport shipRelease syncDocs weeklyRetro officeHours productReview archReview design-analyze design-analyze-web design-analyze-ios design-language design-evolve design-evolve-web design-evolve-ios design-mockup design-mockup-web design-mockup-ios design-implement design-implement-web design-implement-ios design-refine design-verify design-verify-web design-verify-ios verify-app verify-web verify-ios; do
  [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s" ] || SKILLS_OK=false
done

BRIDGE_OK=false
lsof -i TCP:3100 -sTCP:LISTEN &>/dev/null && BRIDGE_OK=true

RULES_OK=false
[ -d ".claude/rules" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null)" ] && RULES_OK=true

echo "skills-symlinked: $SKILLS_OK"
echo "bridge-running: $BRIDGE_OK"
echo "rules-directory: $RULES_OK"
```

Domain rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically per glob — no action needed if `rules-directory: true`.

If `SKILLS_OK=false` or `BRIDGE_OK=false`, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
> "Agentic Workflow is not fully set up. Run setup.sh now? (yes/no)"

If **yes**: run `bash <path-to-agentic-workflow>/setup.sh` (resolve path from the review skill symlink target).
If **no**: warn that some features may not work, then continue.

If `RULES_OK=false` (and `SKILLS_OK` and `BRIDGE_OK` are both true), do not offer setup.sh. Instead, show:
> "Domain rules not found — run `/bootstrap` to generate `.claude/rules/` for this repo."

Create the output directory for this repo:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG"
```

## Session Context

Load prior work state for this repo from prism-mcp before starting.

**1. Derive a topic string** — synthesize 3–5 words from the skill argument and task intent:
- `/officeHours add dark mode` → `"dark mode UI feature"`
- `/rootCause TypeError cannot read properties` → `"TypeError cannot read properties"`
- `/review 42` → use the PR title once fetched: `"PR {title} review"`
- No argument → use the most specific descriptor available: `"{REPO_SLUG} {skill-name}"`

**2. Load context from prism-mcp:**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context — project: REPO_SLUG, level: "standard",
  toolAction: "Loading session context", toolSummary: "<skill-name> context recovery"
```

Store the returned `expected_version` — you will need it at Session Close.

**3. Surface results:**
- If the response contains a non-empty summary or prior decisions:
  > **Prior context:** {summary}
  Use this to inform your approach before continuing.
- If prism-mcp returns an error, surface it and stop:
  > "prism-mcp unavailable: {error}. Ensure prism-mcp is running and registered."

## Session Close

> **Run at the end of every skill**, after all work is complete and the report has been shown to the user.

Save a structured ledger entry and update the live handoff state for this repo.

**1. Save ledger entry (immutable audit trail):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger — project: REPO_SLUG,
  conversation_id: "<skill-name>-<ISO-timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-08T14:32:00Z>",
  summary: "<one paragraph describing what was accomplished this session>",
  todos: ["<any open items left incomplete>", ...],
  files_changed: ["<paths of files created or modified>", ...],
  decisions: ["<key decisions made during this skill run>", ...]
```

**2. Update handoff state (mutable live state for next session):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff — project: REPO_SLUG,
  expected_version: <value returned by session_load_context>,
  open_todos: ["<open items not yet completed>", ...],
  active_branch: "<current git branch from: git branch --show-current>",
  last_summary: "<one sentence: what this skill just did>",
  key_context: "<critical facts the next session must know — constraints, decisions, blockers>"
```

If either call fails, surface the error:
> "prism-mcp session save failed: {error}. Context may not persist to next session."

# PR Review Orchestrator

Runs parallel domain-specific reviewers and saves findings locally. Does **not** post to GitHub — run `/postReview` when ready.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR

**If an argument was provided**, use it directly:
```bash
gh pr view <argument> --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url,headRepository
```

**If no argument was provided**, auto-detect from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number,title,url
```

If multiple PRs are returned, list them and ask the user to pick one before proceeding.

If no PRs are found: "No open PR found for the current branch. Use `/review <number>` to specify one."

## Step 2: Fetch PR Context

```bash
# Run in parallel
gh pr diff {number}
gh pr view {number} --json number,title,body,additions,deletions,headRefName,baseRefName,headRepository
gh pr view {number} --json files --jq '[.files[].path]'
gh pr view {number} --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'
```

## Step 3: Ensure output directory exists

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/reviews"
```

## Step 4: Triage

Spawn a **general-purpose** subagent with the triage prompt from [triage-prompt.md](triage-prompt.md).

Inject:
- `{title}`, `{body}` — PR metadata
- `{file_list}` — JSON array of changed file paths
- `{diff}` — full diff output

Parse the returned JSON array of reviewer assignments.

## Step 5: Spawn Parallel Reviewers

Spawn **all agents simultaneously** in a single message. Each reviewer receives the prompt from [reviewer-prompt.md](reviewer-prompt.md) with these values injected:
- `{agent}`, `{focus}`, `{number}`, `{title}`, `{diff}`

Each reviewer returns a **JSON object** as its final output (not GitHub comments). Collect all responses.

### Sub-skill Dispatch

After collecting all reviewer JSON outputs:
1. Check for any reviewer output with `investigation_needed: true`
2. If found: identify the single highest-confidence entry (blocking severity + clearest error trace)
3. Ask the user (conversationally):
   > "Found a blocking bug with a stack trace in {path}. Run rootCause to investigate? (yes/no)"
4. If yes: Skill tool: `rootCause`, args: `"<investigation_error value>"`
   - Attach the investigation file path to that issue in the state file under `"investigation"`
   - If rootCause returns `scope-breach`, note it in the state file and continue — do not block the review
5. If no, or no reviewer flagged `investigation_needed`: skip and proceed to writing the state file

## Step 6: Write State File

Combine all reviewer outputs into `~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json`:

```json
{
  "pr": {
    "number": 123,
    "title": "Add auth middleware",
    "branch": "feature/auth",
    "owner": "myorg",
    "repo": "myrepo",
    "url": "https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/pull/123"
  },
  "commit_sha": "<latest commit oid>",
  "reviewed_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "posted": false,
  "posted_at": null,
  "reviewers": [
    {
      "agent": "security-sentinel",
      "focus": "auth, input validation",
      "summary": "Found 2 blocking issues...",
      "issues": [
        {
          "id": "sec-0",
          "severity": "blocking",
          "path": "src/auth.ts",
          "diff_position": 42,
          "summary": "JWT not verified before use",
          "body": "**[blocking] JWT not verified before use**\n\nFull comment text...",
          "type": "inline",
          "addressed": false,
          "posted_comment_id": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the Write tool to save this file.

## Step 7: Report to User

```
Review complete for PR #{number}: "{title}"
Findings saved to ~/.agentic-workflow/{REPO_SLUG}/reviews/{number}.json

Reviewers:
  • security-sentinel (focus: auth, input validation) — 2 blocking, 1 issue
  • kieran-typescript-reviewer (focus: type safety) — 0 issues

Run /postReview to publish comments to GitHub.
Run /addressReview to start implementing fixes.
```
