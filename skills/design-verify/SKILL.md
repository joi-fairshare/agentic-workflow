# Design Verify — Platform Dispatcher

Detects whether this is a web or iOS project and delegates to the appropriate screenshot verification skill. Contains no implementation logic.

> **Tip:** If you already know the platform, invoke directly: `/design-verify-web` or `/design-verify-ios`

## Step 1: Platform Detection & Dispatch

Resolve the shared dir from the stable toolkit path, then follow the shared detection contract:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
echo "$SHARED_DIR"
```

Read `$SHARED_DIR/platform-detection.md` and apply its Detection rules, Platform Resolution table, and Dispatch contract. Dispatch literally, echoing first:

```
dispatch: design-verify-web args=<original args verbatim>
Invoke skill design-verify-web with args "<original args verbatim>"
```

or the same shape with `design-verify-ios`.

All user-supplied arguments (e.g., `[screen-name]`) are passed through unchanged. If a required argument is empty, stop and ask — never dispatch blank.

## Step 2: Read the Sub-Skill's Verdict

After the sub-skill returns, locate its run report and normalize the outcome — never assume the diff was clean:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
RUN_DIR=$(ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/design/verify/"*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
echo "run-dir: ${RUN_DIR:-none}"
```

Read `$RUN_DIR/comparison-report.json` (schema in `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`) and extract `overall.verdict` and `overall.max_diff_pct`. Print:

```
design-verify: <PASS|WARN|FAIL> (max diff <N>%)
```

If no run dir or report exists, report that the sub-skill produced no comparison report and treat the run as FAIL for gating purposes.

## Next steps

Gate the suggestions on `overall.verdict` — suggest `/shipRelease` **only on PASS**:

- **PASS** — `/shipRelease` — diff is clean, ship the release
- **WARN** — `/design-refine` — address the minor discrepancies, then `/design-verify` again
- **FAIL** — `/design-refine` or `/design-implement-*` — significant deviation; do **not** ship until re-verified
