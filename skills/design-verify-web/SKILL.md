# Design Verify Web — Playwright Screenshot Diff vs Mockup

Captures screenshots of the live implementation at each screen's route, compares against the per-screen, per-viewport mockup baselines, and reports region-level discrepancies. Artifact paths and the `comparison-report.json` schema come from `_shared/design-artifact-paths.md`.

## Step 1: Load screens.json and Baselines

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
cat "$AW_DIR/design/screens.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_SCREENS_JSON"
ls "$AW_DIR/design/"mockup-web-*.png 2>/dev/null
ls "$AW_DIR/design/"mockup-*.png 2>/dev/null | grep -v -e 'mockup-web-' -e 'mockup-ios' || true
```

Read `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md` for the screens.json (CD4) schema and baseline naming (CD3).

- **Screens to verify:** the `[screen-name]` argument if given, else every screen in `screens.json` with `"source": "design-mockup-web"`.
- **Baselines:** `mockup-web-<screen>-<viewport>.png` per the screen's `baselines` map.
- **Viewports:** read from `screens.json` `viewports` (canonical: `mobile` 375×812, `tablet` 768×1024, `desktop` 1440×900) — do not hardcode a different set.
- **Legacy baselines:** a bare `mockup-<screen>.png` (second `ls` line) may be used only for a single desktop-viewport compare, with the warning: "legacy baseline — re-run /design-mockup to upgrade".

If a requested screen has no entry and no baseline, or no baselines exist at all, stop:
> "No mockup baseline for `<screen>`. Run `/design-mockup-web <screen>` first."

**Staleness check** — warn (do not stop) when either holds:
- the screen's `baseline_stale` in screens.json is non-null → "baselines predate a design-token update (design-evolve) — re-run /design-mockup-web"
- `mockup-<screen>.html` is newer than its baseline PNGs: `ls -t "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-<screen>.html" "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-web-<screen>-desktop.png" 2>/dev/null | head -1` lists the HTML first → "baseline older than the latest mockup HTML — re-run /design-mockup-web"

## Step 2: Resolve Route per Screen — Fail Loudly

For each screen, the capture URL is `<base-url><route>` where `route` is, in order:

1. the `--route <path>` argument (applies only when a single `[screen-name]` is being verified)
2. `screens.json` → `.screens.<screen>.route`

If neither yields a route, **fail loudly** — never default to `/`:
> "No route known for screen `<screen>` — verifying the root URL would diff the wrong page and produce a false verdict. Re-run `/design-mockup-web <screen>` (which records the route) or pass `--route <path>`."

Mark that screen FAIL in the report with reason `route unknown`.

Base URL: detect the dev server from `package.json` scripts (typically `http://localhost:3000`). If it is not reachable at capture time, release the lock and stop: "Dev server not running — start it and re-run."

## Step 3: Create the Run Directory

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
RUN_ID="$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-<screen-or-all>"
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID"
echo "run-dir: $AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID"
```

All captures, diff images, and the report for this run live under `design/verify/<run-id>/` — previous runs are never overwritten.

## Step 4: Acquire Browser Lock

Single bash invocation (shell state does not persist between Bash calls); note `skill-lock.sh` enables `set -euo pipefail`:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
LOCK_NAME=browser source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"; acquire_lock
```

If `acquire_lock` reports TIMEOUT: "Another browser session is in progress. Wait or remove `~/.agentic-workflow/.browser.lock` if stale." Every failure branch after this point must, in one invocation, re-source (`LOCK_NAME=browser source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"`) and call `release_lock` before stopping. Use `return`, not `exit`, after sourcing.

## Step 5: Capture and Diff — per Screen × Viewport

Run these calls **inline** (no Agent delegation). For each screen, for each viewport:

1. `mcp: playwright/browser_navigate` — url: `<base-url><route>`
2. `mcp: playwright/browser_resize` — width/height for the viewport
3. `mcp: playwright/browser_wait_for` — wait for the page's main content to settle
4. `mcp: playwright/browser_snapshot` — confirm the expected screen actually rendered (headings/landmarks match the screen). If the wrong page rendered (redirect, 404, auth wall), mark this screen FAIL with the evidence — do not diff the wrong page.
5. `mcp: playwright/browser_console_messages` — record errors as report context
6. `mcp: playwright/browser_take_screenshot` — save to `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/<screen>-<viewport>.png`
7. `mcp: design-comparison/compare_design` — reference: `$AW_DIR/design/mockup-web-<screen>-<viewport>.png`, implementation: the capture from call 6. Record the response's **numeric diff-percentage field** as `diff_pct` and save the returned diff image to `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/<screen>-<viewport>-diff.png`.
8. *(optional, only when attributing a deviation to a token)* `mcp: playwright/browser_evaluate` — sample `getComputedStyle` on the deviating element to name the actual vs expected token value
9. `mcp: playwright/browser_close` — once, after the last screen×viewport

Per-cell verdict from `diff_pct` (CD11): `≤2%` PASS · `2–10%` WARN · `>10%` FAIL.

## Step 6: Write comparison-report.json

Write `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/comparison-report.json` per the schema in `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`:

```json
{ "schema": "comparison-report/v1", "run_id": "<run-id>",
  "screens": [ { "screen": "...", "viewport": "...", "baseline": "...", "capture": "...",
                 "diff_image": "...", "diff_pct": 0.0, "verdict": "PASS|WARN|FAIL" } ],
  "overall": { "max_diff_pct": 0.0, "verdict": "PASS|WARN|FAIL" } }
```

`overall.verdict` = worst cell verdict; `overall.max_diff_pct` = max `diff_pct`. Screens failed for `route unknown` or wrong-page render get `diff_pct: 100`, `verdict: "FAIL"`, and the reason recorded in place of the diff image path.

## Step 7: Report Results

**Report honesty (region-level only):** a pixel diff can say *where* pixels differ ("header area differs by N%"), never *why*. Token-level attribution ("border-radius 4px instead of token 8px") is allowed **only** when backed by a Step 5.8 `mcp: playwright/browser_evaluate` computed-style sample; otherwise it is forbidden.

```
[<PASS|WARN|FAIL>] Design Verification — <screen(s)>
=====================================================
Overall:  <verdict>  (max diff <N>% · thresholds: ≤2% PASS / ≤10% WARN / >10% FAIL)

| screen | viewport | diff % | verdict | deviating regions |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|-------------------|

Console errors: <count or none>
Token attributions (computed-style verified only): <list or "none">
Artifacts: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/verify/<run-id>/
```

For WARN/FAIL cells, describe the deviating regions and point at the diff image; suggest `/design-refine` then `/design-verify-web` again.

## Step 8: Release Browser Lock

Always — success or failure:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
LOCK_NAME=browser source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"; release_lock
```

## Rules

- Capture every configured viewport for every verified screen — no skipping
- Never diff a capture whose route or rendered content was not confirmed
- Region-level findings only, unless computed-style verified (Step 7)
- Do not modify any code — this skill is read-only verification
- If the dev server is not running, release the lock, advise the user to start it, and stop

## Next steps

Gate on `overall.verdict` — a FAIL run **blocks** the `/shipRelease` suggestion:

- **PASS** — `/shipRelease` — diff is clean, ship the release
- **WARN** — `/design-refine` — address minor discrepancies, then `/design-verify-web` again
- **FAIL** — `/design-refine` or `/design-implement-web` — significant deviation; re-verify before any ship step
