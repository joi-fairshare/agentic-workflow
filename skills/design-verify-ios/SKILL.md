# Design Verify iOS — Simulator Screenshot Diff vs Mockup

Boots the simulator per `_shared/sim-bootstrap.md`, navigates with snapshot_ui-verified gestures, captures an appearance/size matrix, and diffs each cell against its per-screen mockup baseline. Artifact paths and the `comparison-report.json` schema come from `_shared/design-artifact-paths.md`.

## Step 1: Load screens.json and Baselines

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
cat "$AW_DIR/design/screens.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_SCREENS_JSON"
ls "$AW_DIR/design/"mockup-ios-*.png 2>/dev/null
ls "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-ios.png" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Read `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md` for the screens.json (CD4) schema and baseline naming (CD3).

- **Screens to verify:** the `[screen-name]` argument if given, else every screen in `screens.json` with `"source": "design-mockup-ios"`.
- **Baselines:** `mockup-ios-<screen>.png` (light) and, when present, `mockup-ios-<screen>-dark.png` (dark).
- **Legacy baseline:** a bare `mockup-ios.png` (second `ls` line) may be used only for a single light-appearance compare, with the warning: "legacy baseline — re-run /design-mockup to upgrade".

If a requested screen has no entry and no baseline, or none exist at all, stop:
> "No iOS mockup baseline for `<screen>`. Run `/design-mockup-ios <screen>` first."

**Staleness check** — warn (do not stop) if the screen's `baseline_stale` in screens.json is non-null: "baselines predate a design-token update (design-evolve) — re-run /design-mockup-ios".

## Step 2: Acquire Simulator Lock

Single bash invocation per the lock recipe in `$SHARED_DIR/sim-bootstrap.md` (`skill-lock.sh` enables `set -euo pipefail`):

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
LOCK_NAME=ios-sim source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"; acquire_lock
```

If `acquire_lock` reports TIMEOUT, report "Another skill is using the simulator" and stop. Every failure branch after this point must, in one invocation, re-source (`LOCK_NAME=ios-sim source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"`) and call `release_lock` before stopping. Use `return`, not `exit`, in sourced context — `exit` after sourcing can kill the caller's shell. Never end this skill with the lock held.

## Step 3: Boot Simulator and Launch App

Follow the canonical sequence in `$SHARED_DIR/sim-bootstrap.md`:

1. `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/session_show_defaults` — verify project/workspace, scheme, simulator
2. If missing/wrong: `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/discover_projs` → `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/list_schemes`
3. `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/list_sims` — pick the target simulator
4. `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/boot_sim` if not already Booted
5. `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/build_run_sim` — or the split path: `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/build_sim` → `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/get_app_bundle_id` → `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/install_app_sim` → `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/launch_app_sim`

If any of these fails, release the lock (Step 2 recipe) and stop with the tool error.

## Step 4: Navigate to Screen — snapshot_ui First

1. `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/snapshot_ui` — inspect the view hierarchy. If the target screen is already showing (labels/identifiers match), skip to Step 5.
2. Otherwise read the screen's `nav` recipe from screens.json — an ordered list of `{"action":"tap","target":"<label or x,y>"}` steps recorded by `/design-mockup-ios`.
3. **Capability probe** (per `$SHARED_DIR/sim-bootstrap.md`): before any gesture, check that the UI-automation workflow tools (tap/swipe/type_text) are available. If absent, print exactly:
   > "XcodeBuildMCP UI-automation workflow not enabled — see github.com/getsentry/XcodeBuildMCP/docs/CONFIGURATION.md. Interaction steps will be SKIPPED (verdict capped at WARN)."
   Then, because this screen **requires navigation**, do not merely cap at WARN: capturing whatever screen happens to be showing would produce a false verdict. Mark the screen **FAIL** with reason `navigation required but gestures unavailable`, and skip its capture.
4. Execute each nav step: resolve label targets to coordinates from the current `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/snapshot_ui` hierarchy, perform the gesture, then re-run `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/snapshot_ui` to assert the expected transition happened. If a step's target cannot be found, mark the screen FAIL with the hierarchy evidence.
5. If navigation is needed but the screen has no `nav` recipe (`null`), mark it FAIL: "no nav recipe in screens.json — re-run /design-mockup-ios <screen> (records one) or navigate the simulator manually and re-run."

## Step 5: Create the Run Directory

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
RUN_ID="$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-<screen-or-all>"
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID"
echo "run-dir: $AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID"
```

Previous runs are never overwritten.

## Step 6: Capture the Appearance/Size Matrix

For each screen, capture with `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/screenshot` into `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/<screen>-<cell>.png`, one cell at a time:

| Cell | What | Diffed against |
|------|------|----------------|
| `light` | light appearance (always) | `mockup-ios-<screen>.png` |
| `dark` | dark appearance | `mockup-ios-<screen>-dark.png` when it exists; otherwise capture for the record, no diff |
| `dynamic-type` | one Dynamic Type step-up; sanity-check for truncation/overlap via `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/snapshot_ui` | no diff (recorded observation) |
| `<class2>-light` | a second device class (e.g. iPad) when `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/list_sims` offers one | recorded; diffed only if a matching baseline exists |

Appearance/Dynamic Type switching requires the simulator-management workflow; if those tools are not enabled, record the affected cells as `SKIPPED — simulator management workflow not enabled` and cap the run verdict at **WARN** (the `light` cell alone can still PASS a cell-level diff, but never the overall run).

## Step 7: Diff Against Baselines

For each matrix cell with a baseline, call `mcp: design-comparison/compare_design`:

- **reference:** the baseline PNG from Step 1
- **implementation:** `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/<screen>-<cell>.png`

Record the response's **numeric diff-percentage field** as `diff_pct`; save the returned diff image to `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/<screen>-<cell>-diff.png`. Cell verdict (CD11): `≤2%` PASS · `2–10%` WARN · `>10%` FAIL.

## Step 8: Write comparison-report.json (Run Manifest)

Write `$AW_DIR/design/verify/$RUN_ID/comparison-report.json` per the schema in `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`, with the matrix cell carried in the `viewport` field:

```json
{ "schema": "comparison-report/v1", "run_id": "<run-id>",
  "screens": [ { "screen": "...", "viewport": "light|dark|dynamic-type|<class2>-light", "baseline": "...",
                 "capture": "...", "diff_image": "...", "diff_pct": 0.0, "verdict": "PASS|WARN|FAIL" } ],
  "overall": { "max_diff_pct": 0.0, "verdict": "PASS|WARN|FAIL" } }
```

`overall.verdict` = worst cell verdict (SKIPPED cells cap it at WARN); `overall.max_diff_pct` = max `diff_pct`. Nav-failed screens get `diff_pct: 100`, `verdict: "FAIL"`, and the reason recorded in place of the diff image path. This file is the run's gate manifest — the dispatcher and ship chain read it.

## Step 9: Report Results

**Report honesty (region-level only):** a pixel diff can say *where* pixels differ ("header area differs by N%"), never *why*. Do not attribute deviations to specific Theme values or tokens — there is no computed-style probe on iOS, so token-level attribution is forbidden.

```
[<PASS|WARN|FAIL>] iOS Design Verification — <screen(s)>
=========================================================
Overall:  <verdict>  (max diff <N>% · thresholds: ≤2% PASS / ≤10% WARN / >10% FAIL)

| screen | cell | diff % | verdict | deviating regions |
|--------|------|--------|---------|-------------------|

Skipped cells: <list with reasons, or "none">
Artifacts: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/design/verify/<run-id>/
```

For WARN/FAIL cells, describe the deviating regions and point at the diff image; suggest `/design-refine` or `/design-implement-ios`, then `/design-verify-ios` again.

## Step 10: Release Simulator Lock

Always — success or failure (single invocation, re-sourced):

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
LOCK_NAME=ios-sim source "$SHARED_DIR/skill-lock.sh"; release_lock
```

## Rules

- Never diff a capture whose on-screen content was not confirmed via `mcp: xcodebuildmcp/snapshot_ui`
- Region-level findings only — no token/Theme attribution (Step 9)
- Do not modify any code — this skill is read-only verification
- If the simulator shows an unexpected state (system dialog, wrong screen after nav), record it as evidence and mark the affected screen FAIL rather than guessing

## Next steps

Gate on `overall.verdict` — a FAIL run **blocks** the `/shipRelease` suggestion:

- **PASS** — `/shipRelease` — diff is clean, ship the release
- **WARN** — `/design-refine` — address minor discrepancies or enable the missing simulator workflows, then `/design-verify-ios` again
- **FAIL** — `/design-refine` or `/design-implement-ios` — significant deviation; re-verify before any ship step
