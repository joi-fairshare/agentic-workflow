# CSO — Security Threat Modeling

OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE threat model. Pre-impl (plan) or post-impl (diff) mode. Auto-detects mode from invocation context.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Overview

Runs a two-axis security review (OWASP Top 10 + STRIDE) against either a plan doc or a PR diff. Each finding gets a severity rating and a concrete mitigation. Plan-mode output lands at the canonical `plans/<feature>/security-review.md`; diff mode writes to `security/`. Fits the pipeline at two points: pre-ship gate, or fanned out from `/autoplan` for early plan-stage security check.

**Severity rubric** (2 lines, scale per `_shared/severity.md`): CRITICAL = exploitable as designed / data loss / cannot ship; HIGH = real vulnerability needing preconditions, or an unmet security requirement.
MEDIUM = hardening gap worth fixing, non-blocking; LOW = defense-in-depth nit.

## Inputs

- Mode flag: `--plan <path>` or `--diff <pr-or-branch>`
- Auto-detect: if no flag, try `gh pr view --json number,state` on current branch — if it succeeds, use `--diff <pr#>`; else `--plan` against the newest plan per `_shared/plan-discovery.md`:
  ```bash
  SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
  source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
  PLAN_DIR=$(ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/plans/"*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  ```
- `--output <path>` (optional) — explicit output file path overriding the mode default. `/autoplan` passes `--output <feature-dir>/security-review.md`.
- `--slim` (optional) — compact output: Coverage table, findings, and verdict only

## Steps

1. Resolve mode and target (Inputs block above).
2. Read source material:
   - Plan mode: read the sibling docs per the `_shared/plan-layout.md` reader matrix — `plan.md` + `engineering.md` + `product.md` (legacy aliases: `requirements.md` → product.md, `design.md` → engineering.md, only if the canonical file is absent). A TL;DR alone cannot surface A01/A03 — the engineering doc is where access control and injection surfaces live.
   - Diff mode: `gh pr diff <pr#>` OR `git diff main...HEAD` if branch-based. Also check the newest `plans/*/security-review.md` for a prior plan-stage threat model of this feature and read it if present.
3. **OWASP Top 10 pass** — evaluate ALL ten categories A01–A10 (enumerated in the Coverage table below); every category must appear in the output (findings, `No findings.`, or `N/A — <reason>`).
4. **STRIDE pass** — identify findings for each of: **S**poofing · **T**ampering · **R**epudiation · **I**nformation Disclosure · **D**enial of Service · **E**levation of Privilege.
5. For each finding: title, severity (per the rubric above and `_shared/severity.md`), description, attack scenario, mitigation.
6. Resolve target slug:
   - Plan mode: `<feature>` (parent dir of plan.md)
   - Diff mode: `pr-<pr#>` or `branch-<branch-name>`
7. Resolve output path:
   - If `--output <path>` was provided, use it verbatim. Ensure the parent dir exists with `mkdir -p "$(dirname <path>)"`.
   - Plan mode default: the **canonical** `$AW_DIR/plans/<feature>/security-review.md` — the same path `/autoplan` uses, so diff-mode runs and downstream skills can always find the plan-stage model. Optionally also copy to `$AW_DIR/security/<target-slug>-threat-model.md` if the user asks for it.
   - Diff mode default: `$AW_DIR/security/<target-slug>-threat-model.md`. Ensure the `security/` dir exists.
8. Write to the resolved output path:
   ```markdown
   # Threat Model — <target>

   **Mode:** plan | diff
   **Source:** <path or pr#>
   **Reviewed:** <ISO date>

   ## Summary
   <3–5 sentences. Worst findings, overall posture.>

   ## Coverage
   <All 10 rows mandatory — an unchecked category must never look clean.>
   | Category | Status |
   |---|---|
   | A01 Broken Access Control | findings: N / No findings. / N/A — <reason> |
   | A02 Cryptographic Failures | … |
   | A03 Injection | … |
   | A04 Insecure Design | … |
   | A05 Security Misconfiguration | … |
   | A06 Vulnerable & Outdated Components | … |
   | A07 Identification & Authentication Failures | … |
   | A08 Software & Data Integrity Failures | … |
   | A09 Security Logging & Monitoring Failures | … |
   | A10 SSRF | … |

   ## OWASP Top 10 findings
   <ALL 10 headings A01–A10 are mandatory. A heading with nothing to report
   contains the literal `No findings.` or `N/A — <reason>` — never omit it.>
   ### A01 — Broken Access Control
   - **<title>** [CRITICAL]
     - Where: <file:line or plan-line>
     - Attack: <scenario>
     - Mitigation: <concrete fix>
   ### A02 — Cryptographic Failures
   <findings, `No findings.`, or `N/A — <reason>`>
   <etc. through A10>

   ## STRIDE findings
   ### S — Spoofing
   <findings or "No findings.">
   <etc.>

   ## Verdict
   - **Critical findings:** N
   - **High findings:** N
   - **Recommendation:** SHIP | FIX-CRITICAL-FIRST | DO-NOT-SHIP
     (rule-derived: any CRITICAL ⇒ DO-NOT-SHIP; any HIGH ⇒ FIX-CRITICAL-FIRST; else SHIP)
   <End the file with the normalized final line per `_shared/severity.md` (CD9
   mapping: SHIP→PASS, FIX-CRITICAL-FIRST→NEEDS_WORK, DO-NOT-SHIP→BLOCKED):>
   verdict: <PASS|NEEDS_WORK|BLOCKED>
   ```

## Outputs

- Plan mode default: `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/plans/<feature>/security-review.md` (canonical — matches `/autoplan` placement; optional copy to `security/` on request)
- Diff mode default: `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/security/<target-slug>-threat-model.md`
- When `--output <path>` is supplied: that exact path

## Next steps

- `/review` — if pre-ship and findings exist, run general code review
- `/shipRelease` — if all findings are LOW or none
- `/rootCause` — if a CRITICAL finding maps to a known incident
