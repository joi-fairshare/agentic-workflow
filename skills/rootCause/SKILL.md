# Root Cause Analysis

4-phase systematic debugging with automatic scope freeze at the module boundary.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Phase 0: Parse Input

Extract the starting point for the investigation from the argument:

- **`--depth N`** — dispatch-chain depth guard (default 0). If N ≥ 2, this run must NOT dispatch any sub-skill (Sub-skill Dispatch is disabled) — report findings only. When dispatching, always pass `--depth N+1`.
- **`--investigate-only`** — diagnose without fixing (used by `/bugFixOrchestrator`, whose implementers write the fix). Run Phases 0–3.5, skip Phase 4, write the Phase 5 report + handoff with status `diagnosed`, and never dispatch a sub-skill. The working tree must end exactly as it started.
- **Error message or issue description** — the normal entry.
- **Production-incident entry** — if the argument is a JSON object of the shape `{merge_sha, release_id, symptom, logs_excerpt}` (as passed by `/canary` on an UNHEALTHY verdict), treat this as a production incident:
  - `logs_excerpt` is the primary evidence; `symptom` is the failure description.
  - Scope the first suspect set to `git diff <merge_sha>^..<merge_sha>` (the released change).
  - There is usually **no local failing command** — plan for the verify-app journey branch in Phases 1 and 4.

## Phase 1: Investigate

Reproduce the error and collect evidence.

1. **Run the failing command or test.** If the argument contains a runnable command (e.g., `npm test`, a file path with a stack trace hint), execute it to reproduce the failure. Capture the full output including stack traces.
2. **If no runnable command** (production/UI symptom), search files for the error message in the codebase, and write down concrete **repro steps** (navigate/click/fill sequence) from the symptom — these become the verify-app journey used for verification in Phase 4.
3. **Collect artifacts:** full error output / stack trace / logs excerpt; affected files (from the trace, logs, diff, or search); related test files or the repro-steps journey.

## Phase 2: Analyze

Read the relevant source and map the call chain.

1. **Read every file** identified in Phase 1. Follow imports and function calls from the error site back to the root cause.
2. **Map the call chain** — document the sequence of function calls from the entry point to the error site.
3. **Identify the module boundary** — the **nearest common ancestor directory** of (a) the error site and (b) the hypothesized cause site. The repo root and generic top-level source dirs (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`) are **rejected** as boundaries: if the ancestor resolves to one of those, narrow to the most specific package/directory that still contains both sites, or declare the cause-side directory as the boundary and treat the error site as read-only context. Declare it explicitly:

> **SCOPE FREEZE:** Module boundary is `<path-or-package>` (nearest common ancestor of `<error-site>` and `<cause-site>`). All fixes in Phase 4 must stay within this boundary.

## Phase 3: Hypothesize

Generate 2-3 hypotheses ranked by likelihood. Document each as: **Hypothesis** (one-sentence suspected cause) · **Confirms if** (evidence that would confirm it) · **Rules out if** (evidence that would eliminate it) · **Likelihood** (High / Medium / Low).

## Phase 3.5: Confirm Before Editing

**Run the "Confirms if" check for hypothesis #1 BEFORE editing any code** — add the log line, run the narrowed test, inspect the state, whatever the check specifies.

- **Confirmed** → proceed to Phase 4 with hypothesis #1.
- **Ruled out** → record the result in the hypotheses table, promote hypothesis #2, and run its check.
- Never implement a fix whose hypothesis has not been confirmed by its own check. "Confirms if / Rules out if" is an executable contract, not documentation.

**With `--investigate-only`:** run the confirm check for each hypothesis in order until one is confirmed or all are ruled out, recording every result. Revert any temporary instrumentation (log lines, narrowed test edits) — `git status --porcelain` must show nothing you added. Then skip Phase 4 and go to Phase 5 with status `diagnosed`.

## Phase 4: Implement

Fix the confirmed cause.

1. **Implement the fix** for the confirmed hypothesis. All changes MUST stay within the declared module boundary.
2. **Verify:**
   - If a local failing command exists, re-run it.
   - If the symptom is production/UI-only (no local failing command), run the app-path check instead: **Invoke skill `verify-app`** with args `--yes --journey <repro steps from Phase 1>`. The fix is verified only on a PASS verdict in the resulting evidence pack.
3. **If verification still fails**, revert the change, return to Phase 3.5 for the next hypothesis. Repeat up to hypothesis #3.
4. **If a fix requires changes outside the module boundary**, do NOT make the change. Instead, flag it:

> **SCOPE BREACH:** Fixing this requires changes in `<outside-path>`. Asking the user for permission before proceeding.

Then **Ask the user** whether to expand the scope or stop.

## Phase 5: Write Investigation Report + Handoff

Write the report to `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/investigations/{timestamp}-{slug}.md` where:
- `{timestamp}` is `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss` format
- `{slug}` is a short kebab-case summary of the error (max 40 chars)

(Re-derive the paths in bash via the shared helper — shell state does not persist between blocks:)
```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/investigations/<slug>"
```

Report format:

```markdown
# Investigation: {short description}

**Date:** {ISO timestamp}
**Status:** {fixed | unfixed | scope-breach | diagnosed}

## Error Description
{Original error message and context}

## Module Boundary
`{declared boundary path}`

## Call Chain
{entry-point} -> {fn1} -> {fn2} -> {error-site}

## Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Likelihood | Result |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | High | {confirmed/ruled-out/untested} |
| 2 | {description} | Medium | {confirmed/ruled-out/untested} |
| 3 | {description} | Low | {confirmed/ruled-out/untested} |

## Root Cause
{Confirmed root cause explanation}

## Fix Applied
{Description of the fix}
- `{file}:{line}` — {what changed}

## Verification
{Command run and its output — pass/fail; or the verify-app journey + evidence pack path and verdict}
```

**Also write the handoff file** to `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/investigations/<slug>/handoff.md` — this is the structured input `/bugHunt --from-investigation <path>` consumes, so the full investigation is never discarded:

```markdown
# Handoff: {slug}

status: {fixed | unfixed | scope-breach | diagnosed}
report: {absolute path to the investigation report}
boundary: {declared module boundary path}
repro: {failing command, or the verify-app journey steps}

## Root Cause
{confirmed or best-supported root cause, one paragraph}

## Hypotheses

| # | Hypothesis | Cause-site files | Likelihood | Result |
|---|-----------|------------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | `{file}`, `{file}` | High | {confirmed/ruled-out/untested} |

## Ruled Out
- {hypothesis} — {evidence that ruled it out}

## Suggested Fix
{concrete fix direction, file paths, constraints}
```

## Phase 6: Report to User

```
Root cause analysis complete.

Status: {fixed | unfixed | scope-breach | diagnosed}
Module boundary: {path}
Root cause: {one-line summary}
Report: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/investigations/{filename}
Handoff: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/investigations/{slug}/handoff.md
```

**End the response with exactly one fenced JSON block** (machine-readable tail — `/review` and other callers parse this):

```json
{ "status": "fixed | unfixed | scope-breach | diagnosed", "report_path": "<absolute report path>", "boundary": "<boundary path>" }
```

### Sub-skill Dispatch

Never with `--investigate-only` (status `diagnosed` is the intended end — the caller fixes). Otherwise, if Phase 4 ends with status `unfixed` or `scope-breach`, **and** the depth guard allows (`--depth` < 2):
> **Invoke skill `bugHunt`** with args `--from-investigation <handoff.md path> --depth <N+1>`

Do not invoke bugHunt if the fix was verified — rootCause's own report is sufficient on success. At depth ≥ 2, stop the chain and report only.

## Next steps

- `/bugHunt --from-investigation <handoff path>` — auto-fix the bug using the full diagnosis
- `/review` — re-review the codebase after applying fixes
