# Design Evolve iOS — Merge Swift Reference into Design Language

Extracts design tokens from a local Swift reference file or Xcode project and selectively merges them into the existing `design-tokens.json`.

## Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

Both `.impeccable.md` and `design-tokens.json` must exist. If either is missing:
> "No existing design language found. Run `/design-analyze-ios` and `/design-language` first to establish a baseline."

## Step 2: Validate Argument

The argument must be a local path to a `.swift` file or a directory containing Swift files / an Xcode project. If no argument provided, **ask the user**:
> "Provide the path to a Theme.swift file or Xcode project directory to extract tokens from:"

Verify the path exists (read the file or glob for it). If not found:
> "Path not found: `<path>`. Check the path and retry."

## Step 3: Extract Tokens from Reference (shared procedure)

Resolve the shared dir from the stable toolkit path:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
echo "extraction: $SHARED_DIR/ios-token-extraction.md"
```

Locate the Swift sources at the given path:
- A single `.swift` file → read it directly
- A directory → `<path>/**/*.swift` and read files containing `Color(`, `Font.`, or spacing constants

Read `$SHARED_DIR/ios-token-extraction.md` and follow it exactly — colors (xcassets + Swift patterns), typography, the restricted spacing rule (CGFloat type + spacing/layout name pattern only), and the completeness gate (<3 colors or 0 typography ⇒ report shortfall + **Ask the user**).

## Step 4: Merge (shared algorithm)

Read `$SHARED_DIR/token-merge.md` and follow it exactly:

- **Step A** — category diff table (NEW / DIFFERENT / UNCHANGED) against current `design-tokens.json`, source = `<path>`
- **Step B** — **Ask the user** Adopt / Adapt / Ignore per group; **Adapt requires the follow-up **Ask the user** capturing the literal replacement value**
- **Step C** — write merged `design-tokens.json` (tokens not present in the reference are always preserved); **unconditionally** append the consultation to `.impeccable.md ## Sources`; set `baseline_stale` in `screens.json` when anything was adopted or adapted
- **Step D** — report counts and exact before→after values

## Next steps

- `/design-mockup-ios` — rebuild the SwiftUI mockup with the updated tokens (existing baselines are now marked stale)
- `/design-refine` — apply the evolved language to existing views
