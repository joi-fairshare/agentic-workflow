# Ship Release

Syncs your branch, runs tests, audits coverage, pushes, opens a PR, and optionally invokes `/syncDocs`.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Step 1: Pre-flight Checks

1. Confirm the working tree is clean:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   If the output is non-empty, **stop** and ask the user to commit or stash their changes before continuing.

2. Parse arguments:
   - `--base <branch>` — the base branch to rebase onto and target for the PR. Default: `main`.
   - `--skip-docs` — if present, skip the `/syncDocs` invocation in the final auto-chain step.
   - `--no-deploy` — if present, skip the `/landAndDeploy` auto-chain (Step 7) and fall through directly to `/syncDocs`. Use for release-branch workflows where merge happens elsewhere or deployment is manual.
   - `--min-coverage <pct>` — optional. If coverage is measurable and below this threshold, **stop** before push and report.

3. Derive the current branch name:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   If on `main` (or the same as `--base`), **stop** and tell the user: "You are on the base branch. Check out a feature branch first."

## Step 2: Sync

Fetch the latest from origin and rebase on the base branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/{base}
```

If the rebase encounters conflicts, **stop** immediately and tell the user:
> "Rebase conflicts detected. Resolve them manually, then run `/shipRelease` again."

Do **not** attempt to auto-resolve conflicts.

## Step 3: Test

Resolve the shared dir from this skill's own symlink, then detect the runner:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
```

Read `$SHARED_DIR/test-runner-detection.md` and set `TEST_CMD` from its runner table. If no runner is detected, report "tests: n/a — excluded from scoring" and continue (never score an undetected runner as a failure).

Run `TEST_CMD`. If **any tests fail**, **stop** and report:
- Which test runner was used
- The full failure output
- A summary of which tests failed

Do not proceed to push or PR creation on test failure.

## Step 4: Coverage Audit

Set `COVERAGE_CMD` from the coverage table in `$SHARED_DIR/test-runner-detection.md` (already read in Step 3).

If coverage tooling is available:
- Run `COVERAGE_CMD` and report the overall coverage percentage.
- List any files below 80% coverage as warnings (do not fail the release for low coverage).
- If `--min-coverage` was passed and overall coverage is below it, **stop** and report the shortfall.

If no coverage tools are detected, note "Coverage: not available" and continue.

## Step 4.5: App Verification (user-facing diffs)

Check whether the diff touches UI or routes:

```bash
git diff origin/{base}..HEAD --name-only
```

If any changed file is a UI component, page, route, template, or stylesheet:

1. **Invoke skill `verify-app`** with args `--yes auto` — auto mode infers screens from the diff; `--yes` skips the confirmation re-prompt. A `FAIL` verdict **blocks the push**: stop and report the evidence-pack path.
2. **Baseline check:** if `~/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/design/screens.json` exists and any of its screens match the changed files/routes, also **Invoke skill `design-verify`**. A FAIL diff (>10%) blocks the push.

If the diff is not user-facing, note "verification: n/a (no UI/route changes)" and continue.

## Step 5: Push

Push the branch to origin:

```bash
git push origin {branch}
```

If the push fails (e.g., rejected due to non-fast-forward), report the error and stop.

## Step 6: Open PR

**Duplicate check first.** If a PR already exists for this branch, report its URL and skip creation:
```bash
gh pr list --head {branch} --base {base} --json number,url
```

Build the PR body from the template in `$SHARED_DIR/pr-body.md` (read it; re-source `SHARED_DIR` as in Step 3 — shell state does not persist between shell calls):

- `## Summary` — commits since divergence: `git log origin/{base}..HEAD --format="- %s" --no-merges`, plus the "why".
- `## Evidence` — pull the **newest verification pack**:
  ```bash
  source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
  ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/verification/"*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1
  ```
  Embed the pack's `evidence` text per `$SHARED_DIR/evidence-pack.md`: the verdict line, journey table, mockup diff %, and cross-check raw output — plus artifact paths. Never just a pointer.
- `## Tests` — runner + counts from Step 3. `## Coverage` — % from Step 4 (or "not available") + files below 80%.
- `## Key decisions` / `## Review resolution` per the template (`None.` when empty).

**Draft-only rule (CD13):** if the diff is user-facing (Step 4.5) and the verification pack is **missing or its verdict is FAIL**, do NOT open a ready PR — create it with `--draft` and a warning checkbox noting the missing/failed evidence.

Create the PR with `gh pr create --base {base} --head {branch} --title "{branch}" --body "..."` (adding `--draft` when the rule above applies). Capture the PR URL and number for the report and the next step.

## Step 7: Auto-chain `/landAndDeploy`

Unless `--no-deploy` was passed, first write the structured ship→deploy handoff (read + deleted by `/landAndDeploy`):

```bash
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/releases"
cat > "$AW_DIR/releases/.pending-ship.json" <<EOF
{ "branch": "{branch}", "base": "{base}", "tip_sha": "{short-sha}",
  "pr": {number}, "pr_url": "{url}", "tests": "passed ({N} tests)",
  "coverage": "{pct}% | not available", "evidence_pack": "{newest pack dir or null}",
  "shipped_at": "{ISO timestamp}" }
EOF
```

Then **Invoke skill `landAndDeploy`** with args `--wait --chained-from-ship`, passing the PR number captured in Step 6. If the user passed `--skip-docs` to `shipRelease`, also pass `--skip-docs` to `/landAndDeploy`.

The `--chained-from-ship` flag tells `/landAndDeploy` to graceful-degrade if `deploy.json` is missing (a first-time user's `shipRelease` shouldn't hard-fail because the deploy wizard hasn't been run yet). It also tells `/landAndDeploy` to fold the ship-phase metadata from `.pending-ship.json` into its `deploy.md` output rather than it being written by `shipRelease`.

The `--wait` flag tells `/landAndDeploy` to poll for merge before deploying — so this step works correctly even though the PR may not yet be merged at the moment `shipRelease` completes.

The `--skip-docs` flag propagates through the entire chain: `shipRelease → landAndDeploy → canary → syncDocs`. Both `/landAndDeploy` and `/canary` forward the flag; `/canary` suppresses its own auto-`/syncDocs` invocation when the flag is set.

On successful deploy, `/landAndDeploy` auto-chains `/canary`, which on a `HEALTHY` verdict auto-chains `/syncDocs` (unless `--skip-docs` was propagated). The full chain becomes:

```
shipRelease → landAndDeploy → canary → syncDocs
```

If `--no-deploy` was passed, skip this step entirely and fall through to Step 8 (direct `/syncDocs` invocation). Use `--no-deploy` for release-branch workflows where merge happens elsewhere or deployment is manual.

Record whether the deploy chain was started or skipped, and whether `--skip-docs` was forwarded.

## Step 8: Invoke /syncDocs (fallback)

If Step 7 was skipped (because `--no-deploy` was passed) and `--skip-docs` was **not** passed, invoke the `/syncDocs` skill directly to update documentation:

```
/syncDocs
```

If Step 7 ran, do **not** invoke `/syncDocs` here — the `canary → syncDocs` chain handles it.

If `--skip-docs` was passed, skip this step.

Record whether docs were updated, deferred to the canary chain, or skipped.

## Step 9: Report

**Release record handoff.** The canonical release-id scheme (CD7) is `<ISO-date>-<short-sha>`, one dir per release: `releases/<ISO-date>-<short-sha>/`. In the default chain the short SHA is the **merge commit SHA**, generated by `/landAndDeploy` — the canonical post-merge identifier `/canary` also uses. shipRelease cannot know the merge SHA at push time (especially for squash merges), so:

- **Default chain (`/landAndDeploy` is invoked in Step 7):** do **NOT** write a separate `ship.md` here. The ship-phase metadata travels via `releases/.pending-ship.json` (Step 7); `/landAndDeploy` folds it into a `## Ship Phase` subsection at the top of its `deploy.md`. This guarantees `deploy.md` and `canary.md` always live in the same `releases/<ISO-date>-<short-sha>/` subdir — no split across two dirs when tip-SHA ≠ merge-SHA.

- **`--no-deploy` invocation (Step 7 skipped):** since no `/landAndDeploy` will run, shipRelease writes a standalone ship summary to `~/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/releases/<ISO-date>-<tip-short-sha>/ship.md` — same CD7 id form, using the **tip SHA** since no merge SHA exists yet (e.g. `2026-05-15-a1b2c3d`). Deploy information will not be available.

  ```markdown
  # Release: {branch}

  - **Release ID:** {ISO-date}-{tip-short-sha}
  - **Date:** {ISO timestamp}
  - **Base:** {base}
  - **Branch:** {branch}
  - **Tip SHA:** {short-sha}
  - **Test result:** passed ({N} tests)
  - **Coverage:** {percentage}% (or "not available")
  - **Files below 80%:** {list or "none"}
  - **PR:** {url}
  - **Deploy chain:** skipped (--no-deploy)
  - **--skip-docs forwarded:** n/a (no deploy chain)
  - **Docs updated:** {yes / skipped}
  ```

Print a summary to the user:

```
Release shipped!
  Branch:  {branch} → {base}
  Tests:   passed
  PR:      {url}
  Deploy:  {chained via /landAndDeploy --wait --chained-from-ship | skipped (--no-deploy)}
  Docs:    {updated | deferred to canary chain | skipped}
  Report:  {handed to /landAndDeploy via .pending-ship.json | ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/releases/{ISO-date}-{tip-short-sha}/ship.md}
```

## Next steps

- (auto) `/landAndDeploy` — chained after PR creation, polls for merge then deploys (skip with `--no-deploy`)
- (auto) `/canary` — chained by `/landAndDeploy` on successful deploy
- (auto) `/syncDocs` — chained by `/canary` on `HEALTHY` verdict (or directly by `shipRelease` if `--no-deploy`)
