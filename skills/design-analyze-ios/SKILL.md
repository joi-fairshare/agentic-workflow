# Design Analyze iOS — Extract Design Tokens from Swift/Xcode Assets

Scans the Xcode project for color, typography, and spacing definitions and writes `design-tokens.json` in W3C DTCG format.

## Step 1: Locate Source Files

### With explicit path argument:
Use the provided path directly (an `Assets.xcassets` directory or a `*Theme*.swift` / `*Colors*.swift` file).

### Without argument (auto-discover):
Find files matching these glob patterns:
```
**/*.xcassets
**/*Theme*.swift
**/*Colors*.swift
**/*Color*.swift
```

If nothing is found:
> "No Swift color definitions or asset catalogs found. Start your project and add a color asset catalog or a theme file, then re-run."

## Step 2: Extract Tokens (shared procedure)

Resolve the shared dir from the stable toolkit path:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
echo "extraction: $SHARED_DIR/ios-token-extraction.md"
```

Read `$SHARED_DIR/ios-token-extraction.md` and follow it exactly for the files located in Step 1:

- **Colors** — `Assets.xcassets` colorsets + Swift theme-file patterns
- **Typography** — Swift font patterns
- **Spacing (restricted)** — only `CGFloat` constants whose names match the spacing/layout pattern; never arbitrary CGFloat constants
- **Completeness gate** — if fewer than 3 colors or 0 typography tokens were extracted, report the shortfall and **ask the user** (different path / proceed partial / abort) before writing anything

## Step 3: Write design-tokens.json

If `design-tokens.json` already exists, **ask the user**:
> "design-tokens.json already exists. Overwrite with extracted iOS tokens? (yes/no)"

Write extracted tokens in W3C DTCG format:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "primary": { "$value": "#6366F1", "$type": "color" },
    "primary-dark": { "$value": "#818CF8", "$type": "color" },
    "background": { "$value": "#FFFFFF", "$type": "color" }
  },
  "typography": {
    "heading": {
      "fontSize": { "$value": "28px", "$type": "dimension" },
      "fontWeight": { "$value": "700", "$type": "number" }
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "sm": { "$value": "8px", "$type": "dimension" },
    "md": { "$value": "16px", "$type": "dimension" },
    "lg": { "$value": "24px", "$type": "dimension" }
  }
}
```

If no Swift color definitions existed (only asset catalog):
> "Created design-tokens.json from color assets only. Typography and spacing tokens could not be auto-extracted — add them manually or create a theme file."

## Step 4: Present Summary

```
iOS Design Token Extraction Complete
=====================================

Sources scanned:
  {list of files read}

Colors:     N tokens extracted
Typography: N tokens extracted (or: not found)
Spacing:    N tokens extracted (or: not found)

Written to: design-tokens.json

Next steps:
  1. Run /design-language to define brand personality
  2. Run /design-mockup-ios to generate a SwiftUI preview mockup
  3. Run /design-implement-ios to generate Theme.swift
```

## Rules

- Never infer colors from view background or text color assignments — only extract explicit theme/constant definitions
- If Swift files use system colors (`Color(.systemBlue)`) without a custom equivalent, note them in the output but do not add a token for them
- Do not modify existing Swift files — read-only extraction
- Convert all CGFloat dimensions to `"Npx"` string format for DTCG compatibility

## Next steps

- `/design-language` — define brand from extracted iOS tokens
- `/design-evolve-ios` — merge Swift reference into existing design language
