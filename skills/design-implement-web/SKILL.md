# Design Implement Web — Generate Production Code from Mockup

Generate production-ready code from an approved mockup, generating token files directly from `design-tokens.json`, then proving the result against the mockup baseline before claiming completion.

## Step 1: Select Mockup

Locate mockup sources in priority order — HTML source files are far more useful for code generation than PNG screenshots.

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
ls "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-"*.html 2>/dev/null          # HTML sources (preferred)
ls "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-web-"*.png 2>/dev/null       # CD3 PNG baselines (fallback)
ls "$AW_DIR/design/mockup-"*.png 2>/dev/null           # legacy baseline — re-run /design-mockup to upgrade
```

Selection rules (artifact ownership table: `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`):

- **No mockups found:** stop — "Run `/design-mockup <screen-name>` first."
- **One mockup:** use it automatically (prefer HTML when both exist for the same screen).
- **Multiple mockups:** list both types with their source annotated and **ask the user** which to implement.

When an HTML source exists, it is the primary reference for layout and structure; a PNG baseline for the same screen is supplementary. **Record which file was actually selected and whether it is HTML or PNG** — the Step 5 report and `implement-report.json` must name the real source, never assume PNG.

## Step 2: Generate Token Files

Generate both files directly from `design-tokens.json` (W3C DTCG: nested objects with `$value`/`$type` leaves). No external bridge is involved.

**1. CSS custom properties — `design-tokens.css`:**

- Flatten each token path to a kebab-case variable: `color.text-primary` → `--color-text-primary`, `spacing.s2` → `--spacing-s2`, `font.family-mono` → `--font-family-mono`.
- Emit a single `:root { ... }` block containing every token.
- If the token set defines dark-mode variants (e.g. `color.dark.*` or dark values in `$extensions`), emit an additional `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root { ... } }` block overriding only the affected variables.

**2. Tailwind config extension:**

- If a `tailwind.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` exists, edit it in place: extend `theme.extend.colors`, `theme.extend.spacing`, `theme.extend.fontFamily`, and `theme.extend.borderRadius` with entries that reference the CSS variables (e.g. `accent: "var(--color-accent)"`).
- If no Tailwind config exists, write `tailwind.preset.js` at the project root with the same `theme.extend` shape and note in the report that it must be wired into a future config.

**Exact output paths:**

| File | Path |
|---|---|
| CSS custom properties | `<project-root>/styles/design-tokens.css` — if the project keeps global CSS elsewhere (`src/styles/`, `app/`), follow the existing location; create `styles/` only if no convention exists |
| Tailwind extension | existing `tailwind.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` edited in place; else `<project-root>/tailwind.preset.js` |

Import `design-tokens.css` from the app's global stylesheet or root layout if it is not already imported.

## Step 3: Generate Component Code

Using the mockup as visual reference and the generated token files:

- Generate React/Next.js components (or plain HTML/CSS if no framework detected)
- Import from `tokens.css` or use Tailwind classes from the preset
- Follow the component structure visible in the mockup
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include responsive breakpoints matching the mockup

Reference `.impeccable.md` for design personality — spacing density, animation approach, interaction patterns.

## Step 3.5: Token Compliance Scan

**Always run** a content search (e.g. `rg -n`) over every file created or modified in Steps 2–3 (excluding `design-tokens.css` itself, which legitimately holds raw values):

```
rg -n '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b' <each changed file>
rg -n '\b[0-9]+px\b' <each changed file>
```

Report every hit as `file:line — <matched value>`. For each: replace it with the corresponding token variable, or record an explicit justification when no token corresponds (e.g. `1px` hairline borders). Unjustified hits must be fixed before Step 4.

**Dark factory (optional):** follow `$SHARED_DIR/dark-factory.md` using its "design-implement (token-compliance)" objective template — gate on `dark-factory.json`, route via `mcp: prism-mcp/session_task_route`, run `mcp: prism-mcp/prism_infer` only on a `claw` target, and verify any reported violations yourself (re-search) before acting on them. Config absent ⇒ skip silently. The content search above runs regardless.

## Step 4: Verification Gate (mandatory)

Run the visual diff against the mockup baseline:

```
Invoke skill design-verify-web with args "<screen-name>"
```

Read the run's `design/verify/<run-id>/comparison-report.json` (schema and CD11 thresholds: `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`). The gate binds to `overall.verdict`:

- `PASS` (≤2%) or `WARN` (2–10%) → implementation may complete.
- `FAIL` (>10%) → print `[BLOCKED]` followed by the failing screen/viewport rows and the required fixes (region-level deviations from the report). **Never print "Implementation Complete" while the verdict is FAIL** — fix the deviations and re-run this step.

## Step 5: Report

Write `$AW_DIR/design/implement-report.json` (machine artifact — consumed by design-verify, review, shipRelease):

```json
{
  "schema": "implement-report/v1",
  "screens": ["<screen-name>"],
  "files_written": ["styles/design-tokens.css", "tailwind.config.ts", "<component files>"],
  "token_coverage_pct": 0,
  "mockup_source": "<selected file from Step 1> (html | png)",
  "verify_run_id": "<run-id from Step 4>",
  "overall_verdict": "PASS | WARN | FAIL"
}
```

`token_coverage_pct` = distinct tokens referenced in generated code ÷ tokens defined in `design-tokens.json` × 100.

Then print (only when `overall_verdict` is PASS or WARN):

```
Implementation Complete
=======================

Target:      web
Mockup:      <actually selected source from Step 1, e.g. mockup-dashboard.html (HTML source)>
Verify run:  <run-id> — <overall_verdict> (max diff <pct>%)

Generated token files:
  <CSS custom-properties path>
  <Tailwind config/preset path>

Generated components:
  <list of created/modified component files>
```

## Rules

- Token files go at the exact paths in Step 2 — never scatter per-component token files
- Never hardcode values that exist in `design-tokens.json` — always reference the generated token files
- Do not modify `design-tokens.json` — it is the source of truth
- If the mockup HTML is available, use it as the primary reference for layout and structure — and report it as the source
- No completion claim without a PASS/WARN verify run recorded in `implement-report.json`

## Next steps

- `/design-refine "align color usage with the token palette"` / `"polish hover, focus, and transition states"` / `"tighten the type hierarchy"` — refinement intents, dispatched through impeccable
- `/shipRelease` — ship once the verify verdict is PASS
- Commit generated token files: `git add <token file paths>`
