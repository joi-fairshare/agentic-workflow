# Bug Hunt

Fix-and-verify loop with atomic commits, regression test generation, and tiered verification.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

Parse the argument string for:
- **Tier flag:** `--tier quick`, `--tier standard`, or `--tier exhaustive`. Default: `standard`.
- **`--from-report <path> --item N`** — entry from a `/bugReport` report: Read `<path>` and take row N of its `## Bugs` table as the bug description (severity, file, line, description). No manual re-description needed.
- **`--from-investigation <path>`** — entry from a `/rootCause` handoff (`investigations/<slug>/handoff.md`): Read `<path>` and adopt its root cause, module boundary, and repro command/journey. Skip re-deriving anything the handoff already answers in Steps 2–3.
- **`--depth N`** — dispatch-chain depth guard (default 0). If N ≥ 2, do not dispatch any sub-skill from this run — report instead. When dispatching, pass `--depth N+1`.
- **Bug description or test command:** Everything after the flags (or the entire argument if no flag).

Tier definitions:
| Tier | Verification scope |
|------|-------------------|
| `quick` | Lint + typecheck only |
| `standard` | Specific test file + related test files |
| `exhaustive` | Full test suite + additional edge case tests |

## Step 2: Reproduce

Confirm the bug exists before attempting a fix.

1. **Detect the runner** per `skills/_shared/test-runner-detection.md` (sets `TEST_CMD`). An undetected runner is "n/a" — fall back to the app path below; missing tooling is never itself the bug.
2. **If argument contains a test command** (e.g., `npm test -- path/to/test`), run it directly.
3. **If argument is a description**, search files to find related test files and **list every candidate test first** (file + why it matched) before running any. Then run the candidates, best match first.
4. **Capture the failure output.** If no candidate fails, do NOT conclude non-reproduction yet:
   - Show the full candidate list you tried.
   - For user-facing symptoms, try the app path: **Invoke skill `verify-app`** with args `--yes --journey <repro steps from the description>`.
   - Only after both routes pass, **Ask the user** whether they can provide more detail / a failing command, or wants to stop.

## Step 3: Locate

Find the bug in the source code.

1. Search files for code related to the failure — error messages, function names from stack traces, relevant module paths.
2. **Spawn a subagent** (explore) to search the codebase if the initial search is insufficient.
3. Read all relevant source files. Trace the logic to identify the defect.

## Step 3.5: Dark Factory (optional)

Follow `skills/_shared/dark-factory.md` — the gate (CD12), the route/infer/verify flow, and the **bugHunt fix objective template** are all preserved there. Fill the template with the root cause from Step 3 and the failing command from Step 2:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
cat "$SHARED_DIR/dark-factory.md"
```

- Gate disabled or config absent ⇒ skip silently to Step 4 (don't mention dark factory).
- Delegated fix **verified by the host** (re-run `TEST_CMD` per the shared flow) ⇒ commit it as in Step 4.2, then **continue at Step 5 and Step 6** — a dark-factory fix never skips the regression test or tier verification.
- Unavailable, refused, or failed verification ⇒ manual Step 4.

## Step 4: Fix

Implement the fix and commit atomically.

1. **Edit the source file(s)** to fix the bug. Keep changes minimal — fix only the identified defect.
2. **Commit the fix:**
   ```bash
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -m "fix: <short description of what was fixed>"
   ```

## Step 5: Generate Regression Test

Write a test that guards against this bug recurring.

1. **Identify the correct test file.** If a related test file exists, add the test there. Otherwise, create a new test file following the project's test conventions.
2. **Write a test** that:
   - Would **fail** on the original buggy code
   - **Passes** on the fixed code
   - Tests the specific edge case or condition that triggered the bug
3. **Commit the test:**
   ```bash
   git add <test-files>
   git commit -m "test: regression test for <short description>"
   ```

## Step 6: Verify by Tier

Detect `TEST_CMD` per `skills/_shared/test-runner-detection.md` (re-detect in each bash block — shell state does not persist). Undetected tooling reports "n/a", never a failure.

### Tier: quick
Lint + typecheck only, using the project's configured tools (JS example: `npm run lint || npx eslint .`, `npm run typecheck || npx tsc --noEmit`; use the detected stack's equivalents otherwise). Unconfigured ⇒ "n/a".

### Tier: standard
Run the originally failing test, plus related test files (same directory or importing the fixed module): `$TEST_CMD <test-file>` then `$TEST_CMD <related-test-files>`.

### Tier: exhaustive
Run the full suite (`$TEST_CMD`), write and run any additional edge-case tests you identify, and **Step 6.5 is mandatory for user-facing fixes**.

### Step 6.5: Verify in the running app (user-facing fixes)

If the fix touches user-facing code (routes, components, views, templates, styles):

> **Invoke skill `verify-app`** with args `--yes --journey <the repro steps from Step 2, as the journey>`

- Recommended at `standard` tier; **mandated** at `exhaustive` tier — do not report `fixed` there without it.
- Record the resulting evidence pack (`skills/_shared/evidence-pack.md`) for the report:
  ```bash
  SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
  source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
  ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/verification/"*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1
  ```
- A `FAIL` verdict in the pack counts as verification failure → Step 7.

## Step 7: Loop on Failure

If verification fails:

1. **Persist and check the iteration counter** (survives context loss — never track it only in your head):
   ```bash
   SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
   source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
   mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/qa"
   COUNTER_FILE="$AW_DIR/qa/.bughunt-attempts-<slug>"
   ATTEMPT=$(( $(cat "$COUNTER_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0) + 1 ))
   echo "$ATTEMPT" > "$COUNTER_FILE"
   echo "attempt $ATTEMPT/3"
   ```
   If `ATTEMPT` ≥ 3 (max), skip to Step 8 with status `unfixed`.
2. **Analyze the new failure.** Read the output, determine if it is the same bug or a new issue introduced by the fix.
3. **Go back to Step 4.** Revert the broken fix if necessary (`git revert HEAD` or edit), then re-implement.

## Step 8: Write QA Report

Write the report to `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG/qa/{timestamp}-{slug}.md` where:
- `{timestamp}` is `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss` format
- `{slug}` is a short kebab-case summary of the bug (max 40 chars)

Report format:

```markdown
# Bug Hunt Report: {short description}

**Date:** {ISO timestamp}
**Tier:** {quick | standard | exhaustive}
**Status:** {fixed | unfixed}
**Attempts:** {n}/3

## Bug Description

{Original bug description or failing command}

## Root Cause

{What was actually wrong and why}

## Fix Summary

{Description of the fix}

### Changed Files
- `{file}:{line}` — {what changed}

### Commits
- `{sha}` — fix: {description}
- `{sha}` — test: regression test for {description}

## Regression Test

**File:** `{test-file-path}`
**Test name:** `{test name or describe block}`

## Verification Results

**Tier:** {tier}
**Result:** {pass | fail}

{Command output summary}

## Evidence

- **Runner:** {TEST_CMD or "n/a — no runner detected"}
- **Verification output:** {key lines from the tier run}
- **Evidence pack:** {`~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/verification/<run-id>/pack.json` from Step 6.5, or "n/a — not a user-facing fix"}
- **Pack verdict:** {PASS | WARN | FAIL | n/a}
```

## Step 9: Report to User

```
Bug hunt complete.

Status: {fixed | unfixed}
Tier: {tier}
Attempts: {n}/3
Root cause: {one-line summary}
Fix: {commit sha} — fix: {description}
Test: {commit sha} — test: regression test for {description}
Report: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/qa/{filename}
Evidence: {pack path or "n/a"}
```

### Sub-skill Dispatch

If the fix-and-verify loop ends with status `unfixed` (all hypotheses exhausted) **and** the depth guard allows (`--depth` < 2):
> **Invoke skill `bugReport`** with args `--depth <N+1> <scope>`

Do not invoke bugReport on success — bugHunt's own Step 8 report is sufficient. At depth ≥ 2, report only.

## Next steps

- `/review` — verify fixes pass code review
- `/shipRelease` — if all bugs are fixed and tests pass
- `/weeklyRetro` — if this was part of a larger debugging push
