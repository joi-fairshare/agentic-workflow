# Design Implement — Platform Dispatcher

Enforces the mockup-first gate, detects whether this is a web or iOS project, delegates to the appropriate code-generation skill, then auto-chains verification. Contains no implementation logic.

> **Tip:** If you already know the platform, invoke directly: `/design-implement-web` or `/design-implement-ios`

## Step 1: Mockup-First Gate

Implementing without an approved mockup baseline makes `/design-verify` impossible — never skip this step.

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
echo "screens.json: $AW_DIR/design/screens.json"
ls "$AW_DIR/design/screens.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "screens.json: MISSING"
```

Read `screens.json` (CD4 schema in `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`). The gate **passes** for the target screen only if its entry has a non-null `approved_at` **and** at least one file listed under `baselines` exists on disk (`ls "$AW_DIR/design/<baseline>"`).

- Gate passes → Step 2.
- `screens.json` missing, screen absent, `approved_at` null, or no baseline file on disk → **STOP** with: "No approved mockup baseline for `<screen>` — run `/design-mockup <screen>` first." Do not dispatch.
- `--no-mockup` passed → skip the gate, warn "Proceeding without a mockup baseline — /design-verify will have nothing to diff against", and strip `--no-mockup` from the forwarded arguments.

## Step 2: Platform Detection & Dispatch

Follow `$SHARED_DIR/platform-detection.md` exactly: recursive iOS globs (`**/Package.swift`, `**/*.xcodeproj`, `**/*.xcworkspace`, ignoring `node_modules/`, `.build/`, `Pods/`, `vendor/`, `external-skills/`); web = `package.json` deps include `next`/`react`/`vite`/`vue`/`@angular/core`; both/neither → **Ask the user** per the resolution table.

Dispatch contract (from the shared file):

1. Echo `dispatch: <sub-skill> args=<args>`
2. Dispatch literally, passing arguments through unchanged (minus a stripped `--no-mockup`):
   - **Invoke skill `design-implement-web`** with args `"<original args verbatim>"`
   - **Invoke skill `design-implement-ios`** with args `"<original args verbatim>"`
3. If the screen-name argument is empty and the gate needs one, **stop** and ask — never dispatch blank.

## Step 3: Auto-Chain Verification

When the sub-skill completes without printing `[BLOCKED]`:

- If its report already includes a `verify_run_id` (the sub-skill ran its own verify gate), do not re-run — surface that verdict.
- Otherwise run **Invoke skill `design-verify`** with args `"<screen-name>"` now. Verification is not a suggestion — this dispatcher is done only when a verify run reports PASS or WARN (CD11 thresholds in `$SHARED_DIR/design-artifact-paths.md`).

## Next steps

- `/design-refine` — polish the implementation (verification re-runs after refinement)
- `/shipRelease` — ship once verification passes
