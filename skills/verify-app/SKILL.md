# Verify App — Platform Dispatcher

Detects whether this is a web or iOS project and delegates to the appropriate verification skill. Contains no verification logic — all execution lives in the sub-skills.

> **Tip:** If you already know the platform, invoke directly: `/verify-web` or `/verify-ios`

## Platform Detection & Dispatch

Follow `_shared/platform-detection.md` — canonical detection globs (with vendored-path excludes), the resolution table, and the dispatch contract. Resolve it from the stable toolkit path:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
ls "$SHARED_DIR/platform-detection.md"
```

If resolution or `ls` fails, stop and report — do not guess the platform. Otherwise read the file and apply it: iOS → `verify-ios`, web → `verify-web`, both/neither → **Ask the user**. Echo `dispatch: <sub-skill> args=<args>` before dispatching, then dispatch literally: **Invoke skill `<sub-skill>`** with args `"<original args verbatim>"`.

## Argument Spec (pass-through)

All arguments are forwarded to the sub-skill **unchanged** — never drop or rewrite one:

| Argument | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `--journey <path>` | Path to a `verification-plan.md` (template: `_shared/verification-plan-template.md`) — the sub-skill executes its journeys |
| `--lenses <csv>` | Narrow the lens set (catalog: `_shared/verification-lenses.md`) |
| `--baseline` | Require visual diffing against `screens.json` baselines — the visual lens fails if none exist |
| `--yes` | Non-interactive: the sub-skill auto-approves its plan |
| `--base-url <url>` | Override app-URL detection (web only; still forwarded verbatim) |
| `--visual` | Include the visual lens |
| `auto` / criteria | Diff-inference mode / explicit verification criteria |

If `--journey` is given but the path does not exist, **stop** and report — do not dispatch with a blank or dead required arg.

## Sub-skill Return Contract

The sub-skill must produce an evidence pack (`_shared/evidence-pack.md`) and report back `{verdict, evidence_path}`:

- `verdict` ∈ `PASS | WARN | FAIL`
- `evidence_path` = absolute path to the `verification/<run-id>/` dir containing `pack.json`

After the sub-skill returns, confirm the pack exists:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/verification/"*/ | head -1
ls "$(ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/verification/"*/ | head -1)pack.json"
```

If the sub-skill returned no `{verdict, evidence_path}`, or the newest run dir has no `pack.json`, **fail loudly**:

> "verify sub-skill returned no evidence pack — verification is not proven. Treat this run as FAIL."

Relay the sub-skill's `verdict` and `evidence_path` verbatim in your final report. A FAIL verdict blocks PR-open / mark-ready (gate rule in `_shared/evidence-pack.md`).

## Auto-chain: design-verify

After a completed run, check whether `screens.json` baselines cover the screens the sub-skill verified:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
ls "$AW_DIR/design/screens.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "no screens.json — skip design-verify chain"
```

If `screens.json` exists and has `baselines` entries for one or more of the verified screens, invoke **Invoke skill `design-verify`** with args `"<verified screens>"` automatically and report its diff verdict alongside the verification verdict. If no baselines cover the verified screens, skip the chain silently.

## Next steps

- `/design-verify` — re-run design diffing on demand (auto-chained above when baselines cover verified screens)
- `/bugReport` — if functional gaps surfaced, capture them as a bug report
