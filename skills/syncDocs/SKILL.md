# Sync Documentation

Refreshes project documentation to reflect recent changes. Updates only the sections that are stale — does **not** rewrite entire files.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Step 1: Parse Arguments

- **Release-id** (positional, optional) — canonical CD7 form `<ISO-date>-<short-sha>`. Passed by `/canary` on HEALTHY. The report in Step 5 is written **inside** `releases/<release-id>/` so the whole release stays in one folder.
- `--since <ref>` (optional) — the git ref the change range starts from. `/canary` passes the release's merge SHA so the docs sync covers exactly the shipped release, not an unrelated tag range.
- `--commit` (optional) — commit doc changes directly to the current branch. **Default (flag absent): branch + PR** (this toolkit ships a block-push-main hook; committing to main post-merge would be blocked anyway).
- `--scope` — accepted values (comma-separated, case-insensitive):

| Value | Target file |
|-------|-------------|
| `readme` | `README.md` |
| `architecture` | first file matching the glob `{,planning/,docs/}ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `changelog` | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `agents` (alias: `claude`) | `AGENTS.md` — the canonical repo-instructions file. If `AGENTS.md` is absent, fall back to `CLAUDE.md`; if `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md` or only an `@AGENTS.md` import stub, edit `AGENTS.md` and never edit `CLAUDE.md` itself |

Default (no `--scope` provided): all four documents.

If a target file does not exist in the repo, skip it and note it in the report.

## Step 2: Gather Changes

Determine the range of recent changes:

```bash
# --since <ref> wins; else last tag; else last 20 commits
LAST_REF="{--since ref if provided}"
[ -n "$LAST_REF" ] || LAST_REF=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "HEAD~20")

git log --oneline "$LAST_REF"..HEAD    # commit summaries
git diff "$LAST_REF"..HEAD --stat      # file-level change stats
git diff "$LAST_REF"..HEAD             # detailed diff for context
```

Store this change context — all agents in Step 3 will receive it.

## Step 3: Spawn Update Agents

For each document in scope, **Spawn a subagent** to update it. **Dispatch in parallel** — all applicable agents at once, per `_shared/parallel-dispatch.md`.

Each agent receives:
- The full contents of the target document (read it first)
- The commit log and diff stats from Step 2
- Specific instructions per document type (below)

**Common rules (append to every agent prompt):** make targeted in-place edits — do NOT rewrite the entire file; if nothing needs updating, return `NO_CHANGES` (subject to the Step 3.5 post-check).

### README Agent

> You are updating `README.md` to reflect recent code changes. You have the current file contents and a list of recent commits with their diffs.
>
> Rules:
> - Keep the existing document structure intact.
> - Update feature lists, badges, and setup instructions ONLY if the recent changes affect them.
> - Add new sections only if a major new feature was introduced.
> - Remove references to features/files that no longer exist.

### ARCHITECTURE Agent

> You are updating the resolved ARCHITECTURE.md (first match of `{,planning/,docs/}ARCHITECTURE.md`) to reflect recent code changes. You have the current file contents and a list of recent commits with their diffs.
>
> Rules:
> - Update the directory tree if files/directories were added, removed, or moved.
> - Update component descriptions if their responsibilities changed.
> - Update key rules or patterns if new ones were introduced or old ones changed.

### CHANGELOG Agent

> You are updating `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect recent changes. You have the current file contents and a list of recent commits.
>
> Rules:
> - Append a new entry at the top of the changelog (after the title/header).
> - Use today's date and the version from package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or similar if available. If no version file exists, use "Unreleased".
> - Categorize changes using Keep a Changelog format: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed.
> - Derive entries from commit messages. Group related commits.
> - Do NOT modify existing entries.
> - If the changelog does not exist, create it with a standard header and the new entry.
> - `NO_CHANGES` is only valid when the range contains nothing meaningful (e.g., only CI/chore commits).

### AGENTS.md Agent

> You are updating `AGENTS.md` (or the resolved fallback from Step 1) to reflect recent code changes. You have the current file contents and a list of recent commits with their diffs.
>
> Rules:
> - Update the architecture tree if files/directories were added, removed, or moved.
> - Update the commands section if new scripts were added or existing ones changed.
> - Update patterns section if new patterns were introduced.
> - Update tech stack if dependencies changed significantly.

## Step 3.5: NO_CHANGES Post-Check

An agent may not return `NO_CHANGES` unconditionally — verify it. From the Step 2 diff stats, collect **new paths and new scripts** (added files/directories; new entries in `package.json` `scripts`, `Makefile` targets, etc.). For each doc whose agent returned `NO_CHANGES`, grep the target doc for those additions **where that doc type should mention them** (README: commands/features; ARCHITECTURE: directory tree; AGENTS.md: commands/structure; CHANGELOG: any non-chore commit). If a relevant addition is absent, the `NO_CHANGES` claim is a violation: **re-dispatch that agent once**, listing the specific missed paths/scripts. If it still returns `NO_CHANGES`, record the discrepancy in the report instead of silently accepting it.

## Step 4: Commit

After all agents complete, check if any files were actually modified:

```bash
git status --porcelain README.md CHANGELOG.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md {resolved ARCHITECTURE path}
```

If no docs were changed, note "No updates needed" and skip to Step 5.

If docs were changed — **default path (no `--commit`)**: create a branch and open a PR (post-merge you are on the default branch, and this toolkit's block-push-main hook would reject a direct push anyway):

```bash
git checkout -b docs-sync-{release-id or timestamp}
git add README.md CHANGELOG.md AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md {resolved ARCHITECTURE path} 2>/dev/null
git commit -m "docs: sync documentation with recent changes"
git push origin docs-sync-{release-id or timestamp}
gh pr create --title "docs: sync documentation" --body "Automated docs sync via /syncDocs for {release-id or ref range}."
```

**With `--commit`**: add + commit directly on the current branch (no push, no PR). Only add files that exist and were modified. Capture the commit SHA (or PR URL).

## Step 5: Report

Resolve the release dir and write the report **inside it** (one-folder-per-release invariant, CD7):

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
RELEASE_DIR="$AW_DIR/releases/{release-id}"  # arg wins; else newest releases/<ISO-date>-<short-sha>/ dir; else mint from tip SHA
[ -n "{release-id}" ] || RELEASE_DIR=$(ls -1dt "$AW_DIR/releases/"*/ 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$RELEASE_DIR" ] || RELEASE_DIR="$AW_DIR/releases/$(date +%F)-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
mkdir -p "$RELEASE_DIR"
```

Write `$RELEASE_DIR/docs-sync.md`:

```markdown
# Documentation Sync

- **Date:** {ISO timestamp}
- **Release:** {release-id or "n/a (standalone)"}
- **Ref range:** {LAST_REF}..HEAD
- **Commit:** {SHA / PR URL / "no commit needed"}
- **NO_CHANGES post-check:** {clean / re-dispatched agents + outcome / recorded discrepancies}

## Documents Updated

| Document | Status | Changes |
|----------|--------|---------|
| README.md | {updated/skipped/not found} | {brief description or "—"} |
| {resolved ARCHITECTURE path} | {updated/skipped/not found} | {brief description or "—"} |
| CHANGELOG.md | {updated/created/skipped/not found} | {brief description or "—"} |
| {resolved AGENTS.md path} | {updated/skipped/not found} | {brief description or "—"} |
```

Print a summary to the user:

```
Docs synced.
  Updated: {list of updated docs}
  Skipped: {list of skipped/unchanged docs}
  Commit:  {SHA | PR URL | "no changes"}
  Report:  {RELEASE_DIR}/docs-sync.md
```
