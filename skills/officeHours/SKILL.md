# Office Hours — Spec-Driven Brainstorming

Runs a structured brainstorming session and produces four domain-owned outputs — one per team — so every participant leaves with a clear assignment rather than a monolithic doc no one owns.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## Step 1: Get the Topic

**If an argument was provided**, use it as the feature/problem description.

**If no argument was provided**, ask the user:
> "What feature, problem, or idea do you want to brainstorm?"

Wait for their response before continuing.

## Step 2: Context Gathering

Read project context to ground the brainstorming session:

- Read `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` if that is all the repo has) and `README.md` if they exist
- **Read bootstrap-generated planning docs** — whichever of these exist in `planning/`: `PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`, `BUSINESS_PLAN.md`, `GO_TO_MARKET.md`, `COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, plus any other relevant docs there
- Search files for any other relevant planning docs (`docs/*.md`, `*.md` at root) and skim the most relevant files

**If product planning docs exist** (`PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`, `BUSINESS_PLAN.md`, etc.), use them to pre-populate Q1 and Q2 context. Before asking Q1, summarize what the existing docs say about the topic: *"I found existing planning docs — here's what they say about [topic]: [summary]. Does this give us useful starting context, or is there a gap this feature addresses that the docs don't capture?"*

**External reference docs:** Scan each planning doc for an `## External References` section — the bootstrap skill appends these when `--product-docs` sources were provided. Collect all referenced sources across all docs, deduplicate by URL/path, and surface them before the first question:

> **External reference docs available:**
> - [{Type}] [{title}]({url-or-path}) — {note} *(from {doc}.md)* — mark inaccessible ones ⚠️
>
> Should I consult any of these during our session? (yes / no / specify which)

If the user says yes (or specifies sources), fetch accessible URLs (fetch a URL) and read accessible local files before Q1 — treat their content as additional grounding context alongside the planning docs. Note sources marked `⚠️ Not accessible` but do not attempt to fetch them. If no `## External References` sections are found across any planning doc, skip this block entirely.

## Step 3: Problem & User Discovery

Work through each question sequentially. For each one, present your analysis based on the project context, then pause and wait for the user's response before moving on. This is a conversation -- do not use the structured **Ask the user** tool here, just present each question naturally and wait.

### Q1: What problem are you solving?

Restate the problem in your own words based on what the user described and what you learned from the codebase. Be specific.

Then ask: **"Is this right, or is there a deeper issue?"**

Wait for the user's response.

### Q2: Who has this problem and when?

Based on the project and the problem, identify the specific user persona who experiences this. Analyze what they are doing when the problem surfaces -- look for specific triggers (events that kick it off) and ongoing conditions (states they find themselves in).

Then ask: **"Who experiences this, and what are they doing when it happens? Are there specific triggers (events) or ongoing conditions (states) that bring the problem to the surface?"**

Wait for the user's response.

### Q3: How do they solve it today, and what goes wrong?

Map the current workaround or status quo. Look at existing code, docs, or patterns that relate to this problem. Describe the current flow, and identify failure modes and unwanted behaviors.

Then ask: **"What's the current flow? What failure modes or unwanted behaviors do they hit?"**

Wait for the user's response.

### Q4: What does the ideal experience feel like?

Based on the problem and user from Q1-Q2, describe what a great interaction with this feature would feel like — not what it looks like, but what the user *feels* (fast, confident, effortless, informed, etc.). Identify the key moments in the flow that will make or break that feeling.

Then ask: **"What's the most important interaction to get right? What would make this feel delightful vs. just functional?"**

Wait for the user's response.

## Step 4: EARS Menu

After Q4, present the EARS requirement types as a menu. Pre-select types based on the Q1-Q4 conversation:

- **Ubiquitous** is always pre-selected (every feature has core "shall" requirements)
- **Event-driven** is pre-selected if Q2 revealed specific triggers
- **State-driven** is pre-selected if Q2 revealed ongoing conditions
- **Optional** is pre-selected if the feature involves conditional behavior, roles, or configurations
- **Unwanted** is pre-selected if Q3 revealed failure modes

Present the menu:

> Now let's structure the requirements for this feature. EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) gives us five requirement patterns. Based on our conversation so far, I've pre-selected the types that seem most relevant, but you can adjust.
>
> **Requirement Types:**
>
> | # | Type | Pattern | Example | Selected? |
> |---|------|---------|---------|-----------|
> | 1 | **Ubiquitous** | "The [system] shall [action]" | "The API shall return JSON responses" | Yes |
> | 2 | **Event-driven** | "When [event], the [system] shall [action]" | "When a file is uploaded, the system shall scan for viruses" | {Yes/No based on Q2} |
> | 3 | **State-driven** | "While [state], the [system] shall [action]" | "While offline, the app shall queue sync operations" | {Yes/No based on Q2} |
> | 4 | **Optional** | "Where [condition], the [system] shall [action]" | "Where the user has admin role, the UI shall show the settings panel" | {Yes/No based on context} |
> | 5 | **Unwanted** | "If [unwanted condition], the [system] shall [action]" | "If the database is unreachable, the system shall return cached data" | {Yes/No based on Q3} |
>
> **Which types apply to your feature? (e.g., "1, 2, 5" or "all" or "drop 3")**

Wait for the user's response. Parse their selection (numbers, "all", or "drop N" syntax).

## Step 5: EARS Deep Dive

For each selected EARS type, run a focused sub-question. Present draft requirements based on the conversation so far and ask the user to refine them. **After each sub-question, wait for the user's response before moving on.**

### 5a: Ubiquitous Requirements (always runs)

Present 3-5 draft ubiquitous requirements that capture the core "shall" behaviors.

Then ask: **"Here are the core behaviors I've drafted. What's missing? What can we cut to keep the MVP tight?"**

Wait for the user's response. Refine the list based on their feedback.

### 5b: Event-driven Requirements (if selected)

Present 2-3 draft event-driven requirements based on triggers identified in Q2.

Then ask: **"Are these the right triggers? Are there events I'm missing, or events that should be deferred to v2?"**

### 5c: State-driven Requirements (if selected)

Present 2-3 draft state-driven requirements based on conditions identified in Q2.

Then ask: **"Are these the right states to handle? Any states where the system should behave differently that we haven't covered?"**

### 5d: Optional Requirements (if selected)

Present 2-3 draft optional requirements based on conditional behavior identified in context.

Then ask: **"Are these the right conditions? Which of these are MVP vs. future?"**

### 5e: Unwanted Behavior Requirements (if selected)

Present 2-3 draft unwanted-behavior requirements based on failure modes from Q3.

Then ask: **"Are these the right failure scenarios? What's the worst thing that could happen, and how should the system respond?"**

### 5f: Approach (always runs)

Based on the codebase, tech stack, existing infrastructure, and the requirements gathered so far, present 2-3 concrete approach options that leverage existing strengths.

Then ask: **"Which of these resonates? Is there something I'm missing about your position?"**

### 5g: Success Criteria (always runs)

Present 2-3 derived acceptance criteria from the requirements gathered so far. Distinguish between leading indicators (can measure in days) and lagging indicators (takes weeks).

Then ask: **"How will we know this works? What would you measure, and when would you check?"**

## Step 6: Generate Four Domain-Owned Output Files

Synthesize the entire conversation into four radically focused files — one per domain. Each file is a standalone artifact with ZERO crossover.

**Ownership principle:** If you need to read another domain's doc to understand your own, the separation has failed.

**Content rules:**
- **product.md** — User perspective only. No technical details, no architecture, no implementation approaches. Product owns "what" and "why" from the user's perspective.
- **engineering.md** — Technical perspective only. No user personas, no business metrics, no UX goals. Engineering owns "how" from a system perspective.
- **design-brief.md** — Experience perspective only. No technical constraints, no architecture details. Design owns "what does this feel like" from the user's emotional perspective.
- **TASKS.md** — Task breakdown only. No implementation details (those live in domain docs). Tasks point to domain docs via references.

**Cross-references:** Each doc ends with a "Cross-References" section pointing to the other domain docs. This is the ONLY place where docs acknowledge each other.

## Cross-References
`product.md` (requirements) · `engineering.md` (implementation details) · `design-brief.md` (experience goals)
```

Task guidelines:
- Order tasks by dependency graph (topological sort)
- Complexity values: `small` (< 1 hour), `medium` (1-4 hours), `large` (4+ hours)
- The `domain` field is `engineering`, `design`, or `product`
- The `reqs` field traces each task back to one or more requirements
- Each task has `owner` (assigned name or "unassigned") and `status` (todo/in-progress/blocked/done)
- Each task should be atomic — one logical unit of work
- Task descriptions use "What/Why/Definition of Done/Reference" structure — NO implementation details in task body (those live in domain docs)

## Step 6.5: Spec Self-Check (always runs)

Before writing, evaluate the four drafted docs against the seven criteria below yourself and print the pass/fail table. This check is always on — no flag, no external service.

| # | Criterion | Pass? | Evidence (doc:section on ✗) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | product.md contains no technical implementation details | ✓/✗ | … |
| 2 | engineering.md contains no user personas or business metrics | ✓/✗ | … |
| 3 | design-brief.md contains no technical constraints | ✓/✗ | … |
| 4 | TASKS.md references domain docs rather than duplicating implementation details | ✓/✗ | … |
| 5 | All selected EARS types present with ≥2 requirements each | ✓/✗ | … |
| 6 | Every product.md requirement traces to ≥1 acceptance criterion | ✓/✗ | … |
| 7 | TASKS.md dependency graph is topologically sorted with no cycles | ✓/✗ | … |

On any ✗: fix the flagged section and re-run the check (max 2 passes). If a ✗ remains, ask the user:
> "Self-check flagged: {failing criteria + evidence}. Fix before writing? (yes/no)"
If no: proceed to Step 7 and note the open issues in the Step 8 report.

**Optional adversarial delegation:** per `_shared/dark-factory.md` (officeHours doc-quality objective template) — gate-checked there; skip silently when not enabled. Delegated findings feed the same table above.

## Step 7: Write the Output Directory

Generate a URL-safe slug from the title (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars). Create the output directory and write all four files:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
mkdir -p "$AW_DIR/plans/${TIMESTAMP}-{slug}"
```

Write the four files to `$AW_DIR/plans/{timestamp}-{slug}/`: `product.md`, `engineering.md`, `design-brief.md`, `TASKS.md`. These filenames are the canonical manifest in `_shared/plan-layout.md` — downstream lenses resolve them via its reader matrix, so never rename them.

## Step 7.5: Write the consolidated plan summary

After the four domain docs are written, write `plans/{timestamp}-{slug}/plan.md` — a 1-page consolidated summary that downstream skills (`/autoplan`, `/planDesignReview`, `/planDevexReview`, `/cso --plan`, `/design-shotgun`) auto-discover per `_shared/plan-discovery.md`. This file is the canonical handoff — every plan-stage skill reads it first.

Structure:

```markdown
# Plan: <feature title>

**Generated:** <ISO date> by officeHours
**Feature dir:** plans/<feature>/

## TL;DR
<2-3 sentences capturing the feature in plain English>

## Problem
<from product.md — the why>

## Approach
<from engineering.md — the how>

## User experience
<from design-brief.md — the look/feel>

## Open questions
<bullet list — anything ambiguous>

## Sources consulted
<Provenance of external grounding: every planning doc, external reference (URL or
file path), and fetched URL actually read during Step 2 — one bullet each,
with what it contributed. If none: `None.`>

## Domain documents
- [Product](product.md) — owner: product
- [Engineering](engineering.md) — owner: engineering
- [Design brief](design-brief.md) — owner: design
- [Tasks](TASKS.md) — owner: tech lead

## Next steps
- `/autoplan` — fan out reviews across all 5 lenses in parallel
- `/productReview --mvp` — standalone product lens
- `/archReview` — standalone engineering lens
```

Write the file to:
- `$AW_DIR/plans/{timestamp}-{slug}/plan.md`

## Step 7.6: Traceability Self-Audit

Re-read the **written** product.md and verify every `REQ-*` ID appears in its Traceability table with at least one AC. Print:

| REQ | AC(s) | Covered? |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-U1 | AC-1 | ✓/✗ |
| … one row per requirement … | | |

**If any REQ is uncovered, the run has NOT succeeded.** Fix product.md (add the missing AC or the missing Traceability row), re-verify, and only then continue. Do not print the Step 8 success report while any REQ lacks an AC.

## Step 8: Report

Show a summary to the user:

```
Office Hours complete!

Plan written to: ~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/plans/{timestamp}-{slug}/
(filenames are canonical per _shared/plan-layout.md)

  plan.md          → Canonical handoff — 1-page consolidated summary for downstream skills
  product.md       → Product Team     — {N} requirements, {N} acceptance criteria, {N} success metrics
  engineering.md   → Engineering Team — {N} ADRs, {N} technical requirements, {N} open questions
  design-brief.md  → Design Team      — {N} key moments, {N} UX principles, {N} design constraints
  TASKS.md         → All Teams        — {N} tasks ({e.g. "4 engineering, 2 design, 1 product"}) | Est. effort: {e.g. "~18h eng, ~8h design"}

Separation of Concerns: ✓ zero crossover — each doc standalone; cross-references only for coordination

Summary:
  Problem: {one-line problem statement from Q1}
  User: {persona from Q2}
  Experience Goal: {primary feeling from Q4}
  MVP: {one-line scope summary from product.md}
  Key Metric: {primary success metric from product.md}
  Approach: {one-line technical strategy from engineering.md}

Suggested next steps:
  /productReview       — Product: Get founder-lens feedback on requirements and scope
  /archReview          — Engineering: Review ADRs and technical approach
  /design-mockup       — Design: Start mockup from design-brief.md (run /design-language first if needed)
  /addressReview TASKS — Engineering: Start implementation (references engineering.md for details)
```

### Sub-skill Dispatch

Present naturally at the end of the session:
> "Plan is ready. Would you like a review? I can fan out all five lenses in parallel with `/autoplan` (recommended), or run a single architectural or product review."

Based on response:
- Full review (recommended) → **Invoke skill `autoplan`**
- Architectural concerns only → **Invoke skill `archReview`**
- Product/founder lens only → **Invoke skill `productReview`**
- Neither → done

## Outputs

All under `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/plans/{timestamp}-{slug}/` (manifest per `_shared/plan-layout.md`):

- `plan.md` — canonical 1-page handoff (auto-discovered by `/autoplan`, `/planDesignReview`, `/planDevexReview`, `/cso --plan`, `/design-shotgun`)
- `product.md` — Product Team domain doc
- `engineering.md` — Engineering Team domain doc
- `design-brief.md` — Design Team domain doc
- `TASKS.md` — task breakdown (cross-team visibility)

## Next steps

- `/autoplan` — fan out parallel reviews across product, architecture, design, devex, security lenses
- `/design-shotgun` — generate mockup variants if the feature has a visual surface
- `/archReview` — standalone deep architecture review (if autoplan feels heavy)
