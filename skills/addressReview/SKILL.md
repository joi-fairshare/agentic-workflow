<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

# Address PR Review

Implements fixes for outstanding review issues. The local state file is the source of truth — run this as many times as needed until all issues are resolved.

## Step 1: Resolve the PR

**If an argument was provided**, use it directly:
```bash
gh pr view <argument> --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url,headRepository
```

**If no argument**, auto-detect from the current branch:
```bash
gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number,title,url
```

If multiple PRs are found, **Ask the user** to pick one.

If no PRs are found: "No open PR found for the current branch. Use `/addressReview <number>` to specify one."

## Step 2: Load State File

Read `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/reviews/{number}.json`.

If the file does not exist:
> "No local review state found for PR #{number}. Run `/review` first."

## Step 3: Fetch New Human Comments from GitHub

Fetch all GitHub comments created **after** the `human_comments_fetched_at` cursor in the state file (fall back to `reviewed_at` only if the cursor is unset — `reviewed_at` never advances):

```bash
# Top-level issue comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.created_at > "{human_comments_fetched_at}") | {id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, path: null, diff_position: null, source: "human"}]'

# Inline PR review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.created_at > "{human_comments_fetched_at}") | {id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, path, position, source: "human"}]'
```

Filter out comments posted by bots or CI systems (check `user.login` for `[bot]` suffix or known CI usernames).

Append any new comments to a `human_comments` array in the state file, then advance the cursor: set `human_comments_fetched_at` to now — this prevents re-triaging the same comments on every loop iteration.

## Step 4: Build the Issue List

Collect all unaddressed items:

**From state file** (`addressed: false`):
- All issues across all `reviewers[].issues` entries

**From new human comments** (all — humans comment when something needs attention):
- Each comment becomes a candidate issue for triage

**Filter by severity** (for structured issues):
- Default: `blocking` and `issue` only
- Pass `--all` to include `suggestion` and `nit` — `/specToProvenPR`'s review loop **always** invokes `/addressReview --all`; its loop-to-zero gate cannot terminate if suggestions/nits are dropped

Report to the user:
```
PR #{number}: "{title}"

Outstanding items:
  X blocking   (structured)
  Y issue      (structured)
  Z new human comments
  (W suggestions/nits excluded — pass --all to include)
Already addressed: N items
```

If everything is already addressed, stop:
> "All review items have been addressed. Consider running /postReview if you haven't published yet."

## Step 5: Triage for Implementation

**Spawn a subagent** (general-purpose) with the triage prompt from [address-triage-prompt.md](address-triage-prompt.md).

Inject:
- `{structured_issues}` — JSON array of unaddressed structured issues
- `{human_comments}` — JSON array of new human comments
- `{diff}` — output of `gh pr diff {number}`
- `{file_list}` — changed file paths

Parse the returned JSON array of implementation assignments.

## Step 6: Checkout and Spawn Parallel Implementers

Check out the PR branch:
```bash
gh pr checkout {number}
```

Then **Dispatch in parallel** all implementation agents at once (per `_shared/parallel-dispatch.md`). Each receives the prompt from [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md) with:
- `{agent}`, `{focus}`, `{issues}` — from triage output
- `{number}`, `{owner}`, `{repo}`, `{branch}` — PR coordinates
- `{repo_slug}` — repo slug derived in the preamble

## Step 6.5: Re-verify Before Marking Addressed

Self-reported fixes are not proof. After all implementers complete:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
```

1. **Tests** — detect the runner per `$SHARED_DIR/test-runner-detection.md` (read it) and run the detected `TEST_CMD`.
2. **User-facing fixes** (routes, UI components, styles) — **Invoke skill `verify-app`** with args `--yes` and a journey covering each changed flow; require a non-FAIL verdict.
3. **Push once** — `git push origin {branch}`, only after 1–2 pass (implementers never push; one serialized push avoids parallel-push races). If tests fail or verify-app returns FAIL, the affected issues stay `addressed: false` — never mark an issue addressed without passing verification.

## Step 7: Update State File

After Step 6.5, update `~/.agentic-workflow/<repo-slug>/reviews/{number}.json`:

For each result with status `fixed` or `answered` (the only statuses — there is no defer status), when covered by passing verification:
- Set `"addressed": true`
- Set `"addressed_at"` to current ISO timestamp
- Set `"addressed_by"` to the agent name
- Set `"fix_commit"` to the commit SHA the agent reported

For each `unresolved` entry an implementer returned: keep `"addressed": false` and record the reason under `"unresolved_reason"`.

For new human comments that were addressed, add them to the state file under `human_comments` with the same fields.

Update `"last_addressed_at"` at the top level.

Edit the file in place.

## Step 8: Report

```
Address complete for PR #{number}: "{title}"

Implemented:
  • security-engineer — 2 issues fixed (commit abc1234)
  • typescript-pro — 1 issue fixed (commit def5678)

WARNING — unresolved items remain (addressed: false):
  [blocking] src/auth.ts — JWT not verified (reason: requires refactor beyond flagged scope)
These are NOT deferred to a follow-up. Re-run /addressReview or fix manually before shipping.

Run /addressReview again to continue, or /postReview to publish.
```

## Next steps

- `/review` — verify fixes don't introduce new issues
- `/shipRelease` — if all blockers resolved, ship the changes
