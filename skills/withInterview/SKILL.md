# Interview Before Executing

Runs a structured, multi-round interview to gather requirements and context before executing a task. Surfaces ambiguities, challenges assumptions, and confirms subagent strategy — then proceeds only after explicit user confirmation.

<!-- preamble -->
**Before anything else:** read `$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_preamble.md` and follow it (skill index, provider capability map, bootstrap check, session context). Run its **Session Close** section when this skill finishes.

## The Task

$ARGUMENTS

The first token of the arguments is the **target skill** to run after the interview (e.g. `/withInterview officeHours add dark mode`). Record it now — the interview ends by invoking it. If no skill name is given, ask which skill (or "none — execute directly") before Round 1.

## Interview Process

### Setup: Interview Directory

Create the plan directory (layout per `_shared/plan-layout.md`) before Round 1. Derive `<slug>` as 2–4 kebab-case words from the task:

```bash
SHARED_DIR="$HOME/.agentic-workflow/toolkit/skills/_shared"
source "$SHARED_DIR/repo-slug.sh"
PLAN_DIR="$AW_DIR/plans/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-<slug>"
mkdir -p "$PLAN_DIR"
echo "plan-dir: $PLAN_DIR"
```

All interview artifacts go to `$PLAN_DIR/interview.md`. Persist each round's questions there as they are asked (append per round) so the question list can be re-rendered on demand later.

### Round 1: Initial Analysis & High-Level Questions

Read the task above carefully. Identify: ambiguities or underspecified requirements; decisions with more than one reasonable answer; missing context that would change the approach; unclear scope boundaries; and **scope/time-box constraints** — flags like `--slim` or phrases like "30 min", "quick pass" — captured verbatim (they go into the artifact and are forwarded to the target skill).

Present your **highest-priority questions first** — the ones whose answers will shape everything else. Emit them as a numbered table with a Theme column, and write the same table to `$PLAN_DIR/interview.md`:

| # | Theme | Question | Options (if any) |
|---|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | scope | Should X do A or B? | A / B |

Themes: scope, behavior, constraints, testing, integration. Keep each question concise and offer concrete options where possible (e.g. "Should X do A or B?" rather than open-ended "What should X do?").

### Round 2: Subagent Strategy

After the user answers Round 1, ask specifically about subagent usage. Present this as a focused follow-up:

> **Subagent Strategy:** Based on what you've described, here's how I'd recommend using subagents. Let me know what you'd prefer:
>
> - **Explore** — for codebase research and file discovery
> - **Plan** — for designing an implementation strategy before coding
> - **general-purpose** — for delegating independent subtasks in parallel
> - **Reviewers** — post-implementation review via `/review`, which selects reviewer agents based on the changed files
> - **None** — I'll handle everything directly
>
> You can pick multiple. I'll also suggest a specific combination if you'd like a recommendation.

These are **roles**, not tool names — map each to the host's agent types when you **Spawn a subagent** (Claude Code: `Explore` / `Plan` / `general-purpose`; Codex and Cursor: their explorer / planner / default agent types, or a default subagent primed with the role).

If the user selects **multiple subagents**, follow up on each: its focus/scope, parallel vs sequential, and dependencies between outputs (e.g. Explore feeding Plan).

### Round 3+: Drill-Down Details

Continue asking follow-up rounds as needed. Each round: reference previous answers ("You mentioned X — does that mean...?"), go deeper on underspecified areas, surface edge cases and error handling, clarify testing expectations and acceptance criteria.

**Run at least 3 rounds** unless the user explicitly says to skip ahead. Keep going past 3 until you can honestly emit the line `Remaining ambiguities: none` — followed by a bullet list of what each round resolved. That literal line is required in the final round; you may not summarize-and-confirm without it. Each round should be a focused set of 2-5 questions (numbered, with Theme column, appended to `$PLAN_DIR/interview.md`), not a wall of text.

### Final Round: Summarize, Persist, and Confirm

Once all details are gathered, present a complete summary:

1. **Task understanding** — what you'll build, with all clarifications incorporated
2. **Approach** — the implementation strategy step by step
3. **Subagent plan** — which agents will be used, in what order, with what focus
4. **Scope boundaries** — what's explicitly in and out of scope, including any captured `--slim`/time-box constraint
5. **Acceptance criteria** — how you'll know the task is done

End with:

```
Remaining ambiguities: none
- <round N resolved: ...>
```

Ask: **"Does this look right? Any changes before I start?"**

After the user confirms, write two artifacts to `$PLAN_DIR` (re-source `repo-slug.sh` first — shell state does not persist):

1. **`$PLAN_DIR/interview.md`** — the full record: target skill, original prompt, captured scope/time-box constraints, every round's question table with the user's answers, the 5-part summary, and the `Remaining ambiguities: none` block.
2. **`$PLAN_DIR/plan.md`** — a TL;DR-form plan shaped per `_shared/plan-layout.md` so downstream discovery (`/autoplan`, plan lenses, `/specToProvenPR`) finds it: task understanding, approach steps, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, and a pointer to `interview.md`.

### Execute

Only after explicit confirmation and after both artifacts are written, hand off to the target skill captured in Round 1 with an explicit invocation:

```
Invoke skill <target> with args: <original prompt> — interview: $PLAN_DIR/interview.md
```

If the target was "none — execute directly", begin the work yourself using the confirmed plan.

## Rules

- Do NOT write any code or make any changes until the interview is complete and confirmed.
- This is a **multi-round conversation**. Do NOT try to ask everything in one message. Start broad, then drill down based on answers.
- Each round should be focused: 2-5 questions max per round.
- Always reference previous answers when asking follow-ups to show you're building understanding.
- The subagent question always gets its own dedicated round.
- Minimum 3 rounds; only the user saying "skip" collapses the interview — and even then, still ask the subagent question, get confirmation, and write both artifacts before proceeding.

## Next steps

- **Invoke skill `<target>`** with args `<original prompt> — interview: $PLAN_DIR/interview.md` — run the wrapped target skill with the interview artifact attached
- `/autoplan` — if the confirmed plan warrants multi-lens review before implementation (it will auto-discover `$PLAN_DIR/plan.md`)
