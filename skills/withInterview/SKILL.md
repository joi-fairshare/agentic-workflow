# Interview Before Executing

Runs a structured, multi-round interview to gather requirements and context before executing a task. Surfaces ambiguities, challenges assumptions, and confirms subagent strategy — then proceeds only after explicit user confirmation.

> ### Meta-Orchestration Convention
>
> Every native pipeline skill ends its response with a `## Next steps` block listing 1–3 recommended successor skills with one-line reasons. This is the meta-orchestration layer — skills hand off through structured suggestions, not by importing each other's logic. Three stage orchestrators (`/autoplan`, `/design-refine`, `/shipRelease`) fan out subagents in parallel and consolidate findings.

## Codebase Navigation

Prefer **Serena** for all code exploration — LSP-based symbol lookup is faster and more precise than file scanning.

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Find a function, class, or symbol | `serena: find_symbol` |
| What references symbol X? | `serena: find_referencing_symbols` |
| Module/file structure overview | `serena: get_symbols_overview` |
| Search for a string or pattern | `Grep` (fallback) |
| Read a full file | `Read` (fallback) |

## Preamble — Bootstrap Check

Before running this skill, verify the environment is set up:

```bash
# Derive repo slug
REMOTE_URL=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "")
if [ -n "$REMOTE_URL" ]; then
  REPO_SLUG=$(echo "$REMOTE_URL" | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
else
  REPO_SLUG=$(basename "$(pwd)")
fi
echo "repo-slug: $REPO_SLUG"

# Check bootstrap status

  [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/$s" ] || SKILLS_OK=false
done

BRIDGE_OK=false
lsof -i TCP:3100 -sTCP:LISTEN &>/dev/null && BRIDGE_OK=true

RULES_OK=false
[ -d ".claude/rules" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/rules/ 2>/dev/null)" ] && RULES_OK=true

echo "skills-symlinked: $SKILLS_OK"
echo "bridge-running: $BRIDGE_OK"
echo "rules-directory: $RULES_OK"
```

Domain rules in `.claude/rules/` load automatically per glob — no action needed if `rules-directory: true`.

If `SKILLS_OK=false` or `BRIDGE_OK=false`, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
> "Agentic Workflow is not fully set up. Run setup.sh now? (yes/no)"

If **yes**: run `bash <path-to-agentic-workflow>/setup.sh` (resolve path from the review skill symlink target).
If **no**: warn that some features may not work, then continue.

If `RULES_OK=false` (and `SKILLS_OK` and `BRIDGE_OK` are both true), do not offer setup.sh. Instead, show:
> "Domain rules not found — run `/bootstrap` to generate `.claude/rules/` for this repo."

Create the output directory for this repo:
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agentic-workflow/$REPO_SLUG"
```

## Session Context

Load prior work state for this repo from prism-mcp before starting.

**1. Derive a topic string** — synthesize 3–5 words from the skill argument and task intent:
- `/officeHours add dark mode` → `"dark mode UI feature"`
- `/rootCause TypeError cannot read properties` → `"TypeError cannot read properties"`
- `/review 42` → use the PR title once fetched: `"PR {title} review"`
- No argument → use the most specific descriptor available: `"{REPO_SLUG} {skill-name}"`

**2. Load context from prism-mcp:**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context — project: REPO_SLUG, level: "standard",
  toolAction: "Loading session context", toolSummary: "<skill-name> context recovery"
```

Store the returned `expected_version` — you will need it at Session Close.

**3. Surface results:**
- If the response contains a non-empty summary or prior decisions:
  > **Prior context:** {summary}
  Use this to inform your approach before continuing.
- If prism-mcp returns an error, surface it and stop:
  > "prism-mcp unavailable: {error}. Ensure prism-mcp is running and registered."

## Session Close

> **Run at the end of every skill**, after all work is complete and the report has been shown to the user.

Save a structured ledger entry and update the live handoff state for this repo.

**1. Save ledger entry (immutable audit trail):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger — project: REPO_SLUG,
  conversation_id: "<skill-name>-<ISO-timestamp, e.g. 2026-04-08T14:32:00Z>",
  summary: "<one paragraph describing what was accomplished this session>",
  todos: ["<any open items left incomplete>", ...],
  files_changed: ["<paths of files created or modified>", ...],
  decisions: ["<key decisions made during this skill run>", ...]
```

**2. Update handoff state (mutable live state for next session):**
```
mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff — project: REPO_SLUG,
  expected_version: <value returned by session_load_context>,
  open_todos: ["<open items not yet completed>", ...],
  active_branch: "<current git branch from: git branch --show-current>",
  last_summary: "<one sentence: what this skill just did>",
  key_context: "<critical facts the next session must know — constraints, decisions, blockers>"
```

If either call fails, surface the error:
> "prism-mcp session save failed: {error}. Context may not persist to next session."

## The Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Interview Process

### Round 1: Initial Analysis & High-Level Questions

Read the task above carefully. Identify:
- Ambiguities or underspecified requirements
- Decisions that have more than one reasonable answer
- Missing context that would change your approach
- Scope boundaries that aren't clear

Present your **highest-priority questions first** — the ones whose answers will shape everything else. Group them by theme (e.g. scope, behavior, constraints, testing). Keep each question concise and offer concrete options where possible (e.g. "Should X do A or B?" rather than open-ended "What should X do?").

### Round 2: Subagent Strategy

After the user answers Round 1, ask specifically about subagent usage. Present this as a focused follow-up:

> **Subagent Strategy:** Based on what you've described, here's how I'd recommend using subagents. Let me know what you'd prefer:
>
> - **Explore** — for codebase research and file discovery
> - **Plan** — for designing an implementation strategy before coding
> - **general-purpose** — for delegating independent subtasks in parallel
> - **Reviewers** (e.g. Rails, TypeScript, security, performance) — for post-implementation review
> - **None** — I'll handle everything directly
>
> You can pick multiple. I'll also suggest a specific combination if you'd like a recommendation.

If the user selects **multiple subagents**, ask follow-up questions about each one:
- What specific focus or scope should each agent have?
- Should they run in parallel or sequentially?
- Are there dependencies between their outputs (e.g. Explore results feeding into Plan)?

### Round 3+: Drill-Down Details

Continue asking follow-up rounds as needed. Each round should:
- Reference the user's previous answers ("You mentioned X — does that mean...?")
- Go deeper on areas that are still underspecified
- Surface edge cases and error handling questions
- Clarify testing expectations and acceptance criteria

Keep going until you have no remaining ambiguities. Each round should be a focused set of 2-5 questions, not a wall of text.

### Final Round: Summarize and Confirm

Once all details are gathered, present a complete summary:

1. **Task understanding** — what you'll build, with all clarifications incorporated
2. **Approach** — the implementation strategy step by step
3. **Subagent plan** — which agents will be used, in what order, with what focus
4. **Scope boundaries** — what's explicitly in and out of scope
5. **Acceptance criteria** — how you'll know the task is done

Ask: **"Does this look right? Any changes before I start?"**

### Execute

Only after explicit confirmation, begin the work.

## Rules

- Do NOT write any code or make any changes until the interview is complete and confirmed.
- This is a **multi-round conversation**. Do NOT try to ask everything in one message. Start broad, then drill down based on answers.
- Each round should be focused: 2-5 questions max per round.
- Always reference previous answers when asking follow-ups to show you're building understanding.
- The subagent question always gets its own dedicated round.
- If the task is trivial and truly has no ambiguity, you may collapse to fewer rounds, but still ask the subagent question and get confirmation before proceeding.
