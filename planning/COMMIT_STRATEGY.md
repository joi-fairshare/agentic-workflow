# Commit Strategy

This document defines how commits are structured, messaged, and branched in the agentic-workflow repository.

---

## Conventional Commit Format

Every commit message follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>: <subject>
```

Or with an optional scope:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

### Types

| Type | When to use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability | `feat: initial agentic-workflow toolkit` |
| `fix` | Bug fix or correctness improvement | `fix: address review findings -- atomicity, security, DX` |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes | `docs: add planning documents` |
| `chore` | Build config, dependencies, tooling | `chore: upgrade vitest to v3` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change | `refactor: extract message validation to shared helper` |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | `test: add edge case for empty conversation` |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) | `style: fix trailing commas in schemas` |

### Scope (optional)

Scope narrows the area of change. Use the package or module name:

```
feat(mcp-bridge): add batch message endpoint
fix(db): handle null analysis in task update
test(services): cover reportStatus error path
```

---

## Subject Line Rules

| Rule | Correct | Incorrect |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Lowercase first word | `fix: address review findings` | `Fix: Address review findings` |
| No period at end | `feat: add task assignment` | `feat: add task assignment.` |
| Imperative mood | `fix: validate task existence before write` | `fix: validated task existence before write` |
| Concise (under 72 chars) | `fix: address review findings` | `fix: I fixed the review findings that were found during the code review` |
| Describe the "why" when possible | `fix: address review findings -- atomicity, security, DX` | `fix: change some code` |

The subject should complete the sentence: "This commit will ___."

---

## Body Format

For non-trivial changes, add a body separated by a blank line. Use the body to explain **what** changed and **why**:

```
fix: address review findings -- atomicity, security, DX

- Wrap reportStatus in db.transaction() for atomic message + task update
- Validate task existence before any writes to prevent orphaned messages
- Restrict default bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) with ALLOW_REMOTE escape hatch
- Add getUnread mark-read atomicity via transaction
```

Body guidelines:
- Wrap lines at ~72 characters.
- Use bullet points (`-`) for multiple changes.
- Reference issue numbers if applicable: `Closes #42`.

---

## What Makes a Good Commit

### Good: atomic and focused

```
feat: add batch message endpoint

Adds POST /messages/batch for sending multiple context messages
in a single transaction. Includes Zod validation and tests.
```

```
fix: address review findings -- atomicity, security, DX

- Wrap reportStatus in db.transaction() for atomic message + task update
- Validate task existence before any writes to prevent orphaned messages
- Restrict default bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) with ALLOW_REMOTE escape hatch
```

### Bad: vague or mixed

```
update code
```

```
fix stuff and add some features
```

```
WIP
```

---

## Branch Naming

Branches use a type prefix followed by a `/` and a kebab-case descriptor:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `feat/<description>` | `feat/batch-messages` |
| `fix/<description>` | `fix/orphaned-message-on-failed-task` |
| `docs/<description>` | `docs/planning-docs` |
| `chore/<description>` | `chore/upgrade-fastify-v5` |
| `refactor/<description>` | `refactor/extract-validation` |
| `test/<description>` | `test/report-status-edge-cases` |

Branch names should be short but descriptive. Use the same type prefixes as commit messages.

---

## Commit Granularity

Prefer **small, atomic commits** that each represent one logical change:

- One commit per feature, bug fix, or refactor step.
- If a fix requires changes across multiple layers (service, controller, schema, test), those go in a single commit -- they are one logical change.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same commit.
- "Fix review findings" commits are acceptable when addressing a batch of related feedback, but use bullet points in the body to enumerate changes.

## Examples From This Repository

```
6176148 feat: initial agentic-workflow toolkit
a0d0755 fix: address review findings -- atomicity, security, DX
```

The first commit is a large initial scaffold (acceptable for project bootstrapping). The second is a targeted fix commit addressing specific review feedback, with the subject summarizing the themes (atomicity, security, DX) and the body (if present) enumerating individual changes.
